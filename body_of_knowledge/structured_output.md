# Comparative Analysis of LLMs for Structured Output: Capabilities and Pricing

Structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important for developers building sophisticated applications that require predictable, machine-readable responses. This report analyzes various LLM providers with a focus on their structured output capabilities and pricing, addressing concerns about Gemini's structured output limitations while exploring alternatives like OpenAI, Mistral, and others that may better serve research assistant applications.

## Structured Outputs in LLMs: Definition and Importance

Structured outputs refer to responses formatted in pre-defined, organized patterns that can be easily parsed and interpreted by machines or humans. These outputs commonly take the form of JSON objects, XML, lists, tables, or key-value pairs that present information in a consistent and concise manner[2]. 

For research assistant applications, structured outputs are particularly valuable as they:

1. Enable seamless integration with other software components
2. Facilitate automated data extraction and processing
3. Ensure consistency in information presentation
4. Support complex data relationships and hierarchies
5. Improve the overall reliability of machine-generated content

The structured nature of these outputs makes them especially suitable for scenarios requiring precision and consistency, such as data processing, report generation, and content summarization[2].

## Google Gemini: Structured Output Challenges

Gemini models from Google have demonstrated notable limitations with structured outputs that may impact their suitability for research assistant applications.

### Performance Issues and Design Flaws

According to recent testing, Gemini's structured output capabilities present several challenges:

1. **Key Ordering Problem**: A significant design flaw exists where the order of keys specified in the schema is not preserved when using the Generative AI Python SDK. Instead, keys are automatically sorted alphabetically, which can break chain-of-thought reasoning in applications[1].

2. **Performance Disparities**: While Gemini's structured outputs generally performed comparably to unstructured outputs overall, constrained decoding specifically (JSON-Schema) showed worse performance than unstructured outputs. In the "Shuffled Objects" task, for example, Natural Language achieved 97.15%, while JSON-Schema scored only 86.18%[1].

3. **Implementation Complexity**: Different approaches to structured outputs with Gemini have different performance implications:
   - **JSON-Prompt**: Including the JSON schema in the prompt
   - **JSON-Schema**: Setting the schema directly in the model's configuration
   - **Function Calling**: Another approach with similar key ordering issues[1]

Google has recognized these challenges and released a new Python SDK that may address the automatically sorting keys issue, though the effectiveness of this solution was not fully evaluated in the available research[1].

## Mistral: Advanced Structured Output Capabilities

Mistral, particularly its flagship Large model, offers robust support for structured outputs through function calling abilities, making it a compelling alternative for applications requiring reliable formatted responses.

### Implementation Approaches

Mistral provides two primary modes for generating structured outputs:

1. **MISTRAL_TOOLS**: Uses Mistral's function calling API to return structured outputs (the default approach)[4].
2. **MISTRAL_STRUCTURED_OUTPUTS**: Utilizes Mistral's dedicated structured output capabilities[4].

The integration with the Instructor library simplifies implementation, allowing developers to define Pydantic models that serve as schemas for the structured responses. This approach enables type-safe responses and ensures adherence to the specified output format[4].

```python
import os
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mistralai import Mistral
from instructor import from_mistral, Mode

class UserDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

client = Mistral(api_key=os.environ.get("MISTRAL_API_KEY"))
instructor_client = from_mistral(
    client=client,
    mode=Mode.MISTRAL_TOOLS,
)

user = instructor_client.chat.completions.create(
    # Additional parameters
)
```

This implementation offers a straightforward path to reliable structured outputs, addressing many of the challenges observed with Gemini models[4].

## Alternative Approaches to Structured Outputs

Besides provider-specific implementations, developers have explored generic techniques to improve structured output generation across different LLMs.

### XML Formatting Strategy

Some developers have found that requesting outputs in XML format may yield better results than plain text or JSON formats. The hypothesis is that the notion of XML might resonate more effectively with models that have been trained on coding tasks[5].

For example, using a prompt pattern like:
```
Output Format in XML: <variable>contents</variable>
```

This approach may be particularly helpful when:
1. The model struggles to maintain a specific format
2. There are optional fields that the model handles inconsistently
3. A hierarchical structure needs to be preserved[5]

## Pricing Comparison Across LLM Providers

When evaluating LLMs for structured output applications, pricing is an important consideration alongside technical capabilities.

### Token Pricing by Provider

| Provider/Model | Input Price (per M tokens) | Output Price (per M tokens) | Notes |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Anthropic Claude Haiku 3 | $0.25 | $1.25 | Good for cost-sensitive applications[6] |
| Llama 3.2 1b (DeepInfra) | $0.015 | $0.015 | Currently the cheapest option identified[3] |
| Llama 405b (Together AI) | $3.50 | $3.50 | Higher capability with moderate pricing[3] |
| Cerebras Systems (Llama 405b) | $12 | $12 | Optimized for speed (~1,000 TPS)[3] |

### Pricing Trends and Considerations

Several important factors influence LLM pricing:

1. **Model Size Impact**: A good rule of thumb is that one million tokens cost about $0.01 per billion model parameters for a regular model[3].

2. **Input vs. Output Costs**: Many providers charge more for output tokens than input tokens. For instance, Claude has a 5x difference between input and output token pricing[6].

3. **Decreasing Costs**: Token pricing is reportedly decreasing by approximately 10x year-over-year, suggesting that even premium models may become more affordable in the near future[3].

4. **Speed vs. Cost Tradeoff**: Faster token processing (higher tokens per second) generally comes at a premium. For example, Cerebras Systems offers ~1,000 TPS at $12/million tokens, while Together AI provides ~80 TPS at $3.5/million tokens for the same model[3].

5. **Context Window Considerations**: Different providers offer varying context window sizes, which can affect both capability and cost for applications requiring extensive prompt context.

## Recommendations for Research Assistant Applications

Based on the comparative analysis of structured output capabilities and pricing, the following recommendations emerge for research assistant applications:

### Provider Selection Strategy

1. **For Production-Ready Applications**: Consider Mistral Large with its function calling capabilities and integration with the Instructor library. This approach offers reliable structured outputs with reasonable pricing and straightforward implementation[4].

2. **For Cost-Sensitive Applications**: Llama 3.2 1b on DeepInfra at $0.015 per million tokens represents the most economical option, though you'll need to test thoroughly to ensure it meets your structured output requirements[3].

3. **For High-Performance Needs**: If your research assistant requires fast response times, providers like Cerebras Systems offer significantly higher tokens per second, albeit at a premium price point[3].

4. **As An Alternative to Gemini**: Both Mistral and Anthropic's Claude models appear to have more reliable structured output capabilities than Gemini, making them viable alternatives for your specific use case.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Formatting Strategy**: Consider testing XML-based formatting approaches alongside native function calling capabilities, as some developers report improved format adherence with XML structures[5].

2. **Cost Control**: Implement token limit controls, particularly for output tokens which are typically more expensive, to manage costs effectively[6].

3. **Continuous Evaluation**: Given the rapid evolution of LLM capabilities and pricing, establish a process for regularly reevaluating provider options as new models and features are released.

## Conclusion

While Google's Gemini models present notable challenges with structured outputs, particularly around key ordering and performance in constrained decoding scenarios, several viable alternatives exist. Mistral stands out with its dedicated structured output capabilities and integration with tools like Instructor, while providers like Anthropic and implementations of open models like Llama offer different balances of capability and cost.

For a research assistant application requiring reliable structured outputs, Mistral appears to provide the most straightforward path forward based on the available information. However, the right choice ultimately depends on specific application requirements around output complexity, performance needs, and budget constraints.

As LLM capabilities continue to evolve rapidly and token pricing continues its downward trend, the landscape of options is likely to become increasingly favorable for developers building sophisticated applications with structured output requirements.
