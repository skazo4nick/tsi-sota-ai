However, maintaining adequate inventory levels becomes challenging in the face of unpredictable demand patterns. Furthermore, the need to disseminate demand-related information throughout a company often relies on cloud services. However, this method sometimes encounters issues such as limited bandwidth and increased latency. Methods: To address these challenges, our study introduces a system that incorporates a machine learning algorithm to address inventory-related uncertainties arising from demand fluctuations. Our approach involves the use of an attention mechanism for accurate demand prediction. We combine it with the Newsvendor model to determine optimal inventory levels. The system is integrated with fog computing to facilitate the rapid dissemination of information throughout the company. Results: In experiments, we compare the proposed system with the conventional demand estimation approach based on historical data and observe that the proposed system consistently outperformed the conventional approach. Conclusions: This research introduces an inventory management system based on a novel deep learning architecture that integrates the attention mechanism with cloud computing to address the Newsvendor problem. Experiments demonstrate the better accuracy of this system in comparison to existing methods. More studies should be conducted to explore its applicability to other demand modeling scenarios."

Smart contracts are scripts on the top of the blockchain technology. They represent a form of automation by what the layers of intermediaries can be reduced or even completely replaced. Accordingly, blockchain smart contracting systems decrease transaction and enforcement costs as well as process time.
Moreover, we argue, blockchain and smart contracts can facilitate cross-organisational collaboration and their underlying business processes. Hence, they are able to support the integration of entrepreneurs and SMEs into trans-national supply chains by reducing high entry barriers and weakening the dominating position of big players.
This paper discusses the research questions how blockchain smart contracting can facilitate the implementation of collaborative logistics structures and how the integration of SMEs into sustainable maritime supply chains can be safeguarded. The research bases on expert interviews and case studies. The results showcase the potentials of using blockchain smart contracting in the environment of trans-national and multimodal supply chains."

Most companies are unwilling to share data or do not have time for annotation. In addition, most available facility management data are text data. Thus, there is a need for an unsupervised predictive maintenance algorithm that is capable of handling textual data. Methodology: This paper proposes applying association rule mining on maintenance requests to identify upcoming needs in facility management. By coupling temporal association rule mining with the concept of semantic similarity derived from large language models, the proposed methodology can discover meaningful knowledge in the form of rules suitable for decision-making. Results: Relying on the large German language models works best for the presented case study. Introducing a temporal lift filter allows for reducing the created rules to the most important ones. Conclusions: Only a few maintenance requests are sufficient to mine association rules that show links between different infrastructural failures. Due to the unsupervised manner of the proposed algorithm, domain experts need to evaluate the relevance of the specific rules. Nevertheless, the algorithm enables companies to efficiently utilize their data stored in databases to create interpretable rules supporting decision-making."

Yet, the governance of the data lifecycle, from the data sources into valuable insights, is largely performed in an ad-hoc or manual manner. This is specifically concerning in scenarios where tens or hundreds of continuously evolving data sources produce semi-structured data. To overcome this challenge, we develop a framework for operationalizing and automating data governance. For the first, we propose a zoned data lake architecture and a set of data governance processes that allow the systematic ingestion, transformation and integration of data from heterogeneous sources, in order to make them readily available for business users. For the second, we propose a set of metadata artifacts that allow the automatic execution of data governance processes, addressing a wide range of data management challenges. We showcase the usefulness of the proposed approach using a real world use case, stemming from the collaborative project with the World Health Organization for the management and analysis of data about Neglected Tropical Diseases. Overall, this work contributes on facilitating organizations the adoption of data-driven strategies into a cohesive framework operationalizing and automating data governance."

Through a survey (N = 1506), we examined public trust across various tasks within education, healthcare, and creative arts domains. The results show that participants vary in their trust across domains. Notably, AI systems’ abilities were evaluated higher than their benevolence across all domains. Demographic traits had less influence on trust in AI abilities and benevolence compared to technology-related factors. Specifically, participants with greater technological competence, AI familiarity, and knowledge viewed AI as more capable in all domains. These participants also perceived greater systems’ benevolence in healthcare and creative arts but not in education. We discuss the importance of considering public trust and its determinants in AI adoption."

In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM’s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial.

They choose whether the hiring decision between themselves and another worker is made by a participant in the role of a manager or by an algorithm. In a second set of experiments, managers choose whether they want to delegate their hiring decisions to the algorithm. When the algorithm does not use workers’ gender to predict their job-task performance and workers know this, they choose the algorithm more often than in the baseline treatment where gender is employed. Feedback to the managers about their performance in hiring the best workers increases their preference for the algorithm relative to the baseline without feedback, because managers are, on average, overconfident.

It leverages business operation decisions, infrastructure, management, and resource planning activities. Since 2015, there has been an increase in the use of deep learning models in this domain. However, there is a gap in works comparing traditional statistics and deep learning models for transportation demand forecasts. This work aimed to perform a case study of aggregated transportation demand forecasts in 54 distribution centers of a Brazilian carrier. Methods: A computational simulation and case study methods were applied, exploring the characteristics of the datasets through autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and its variations, in addition to a deep neural network, long short-term memory, known as LSTM. Eight scenarios were explored while considering different data preprocessing methods and evaluating how outliers, training and testing dataset splits during cross-validation, and the relevant hyperparameters of each model can affect the demand forecast. Results: The long short-term memory networks were observed to outperform the statistical methods in ninety-four percent of the dispatching units over the evaluated scenarios, while the autoregressive integrated moving average modeled the remaining five percent. Conclusions: This work found that forecasting transportation demands can address practical issues in supply chains, specially resource planning management."

Consequently, there has been increasing interest in identifying more advanced statistical techniques that lead to accuracy improvements. However, the inclusion of multiple drivers affecting demand into commonly used ARIMA and ETS models is not straightforward, particularly when many explanatory variables are available. Moreover, regularization regression models that shrink the model’s parameters allow for the inclusion of a lot of relevant information but do not intrinsically handle the dynamics of the demand. These problems have not been addressed by previous studies. Nevertheless, multiple simultaneous effects interacting are common in retailing. To be successful, any approach needs to be automatic, robust and efficiently scaleable. In this study, we design novel approaches to forecast retailer product sales taking into account the main drivers which affect SKU demand at store level. To address the variable selection challenge, the use of dimensionality reduction via principal components analysis (PCA) and shrinkage estimators was investigated. The empirical results, using a case study of supermarket sales in Portugal, show that both PCA and shrinkage are useful and result in gains in forecast accuracy in the order of 10% over benchmarks while offering insights on the impact of promotions. Focusing on the promotional periods, PCA-based models perform strongly, while shrinkage estimators over-shrink. For the non-promotional periods, shrinkage estimators significantly outperform the alternatives."

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal.

The results showed that the applied examples relate primarily to the early identification of production, transport, and supply risks in order to counteract potential supply chain problems quickly. Through the analyzed case studies, we were able to identify the added value that ML integration can bring to the SCRM (e.g., the integration of new data sources such as social media or weather data).

Delays in the supply chain can bring consequences such as the lack of food products by retailers, transporters and manufacturers. Thus, this study aims to examine the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in small- and medium-sized food companies in the central region of Portugal, identifying potential problems and pointing out the respective solutions. For this purpose, the study uses a qualitative methodology through semi-structured interviews. It was found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have a codified supply chain and that generally, these companies have a minimal budget, which requires a constant search for new suppliers that represent a reduction in costs. Moreover, most of the companies surveyed faced unexpected challenges, such as a lack of alternative suppliers. The present paper is original because it studies the supply chain in SMEs in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it allows the ascertainment of practical suggestions for these companies to improve, as well as contributing to the clarification of the literature on the supply chain in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."

For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT’s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs’ exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system."

However, guaranteeing the security and integrity of hydrogen-related data has become a significant challenge. This paper proposes a pioneering approach to ensure secure hydrogen data analysis by integrating blockchain technology, enhancing trust, transparency, and privacy in handling hydrogen-related information. Combining blockchain with intelligent power management systems makes the efficient utilization of hydrogen resources feasible. Using smart contracts and distributed ledger technology facilitates secure data analysis (SDA), real-time monitoring, prediction, and optimization of hydrogen-based power systems. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach are demonstrated through comprehensive case studies and simulations. Notably, our prediction models, including ABiLSTM, ALSTM, and ARNN, consistently delivered high accuracy with MAE values of approximately 0.154, 0.151, and 0.151, respectively, enhancing the security and efficiency of hydrogen consumption forecasts. The blockchain-based solution offers enhanced security, integrity, and privacy for hydrogen data analysis, thus advancing clean and sustainable energy systems. Additionally, the research identifies existing challenges and outlines future directions for further enhancing the proposed system.

But the circumstances under which algorithm aversion or algorithm appreciation are more likely to occur with respect to LLMs have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how texts with moral or technological topics, allegedly written either by a human author or by ChatGPT, are perceived.MethodsIn a randomized controlled experiment, n = 164 participants read six texts, three of which had a moral and three a technological topic (predictor text topic). The alleged author of each text was randomly either labeled “ChatGPT” or “human author” (predictor authorship). We captured three dependent variables: assessment of author competence, assessment of content quality, and participants' intention to submit the text in a hypothetical university course (sharing intention). We hypothesized interaction effects, that is, we expected ChatGPT to score lower than alleged human authors for moral topics and higher than alleged human authors for technological topics and vice versa.ResultsWe only found a small interaction effect for perceived author competence, p = 0.004, d = 0.40, but not for the other dependent variables. However, ChatGPT was consistently devalued compared to alleged human authors across all dependent variables: there were main effects of authorship for assessment of the author competence, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.95; for assessment of content quality, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.39; as well as for sharing intention, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.57. There was also a small main effect of text topic on the assessment of text quality, p = 0.002, d = 0.35.ConclusionThese results are more in line with previous findings on algorithm aversion than with algorithm appreciation. We discuss the implications of these findings for the acceptance of the use of LLMs for text composition."

To be effective, the HAEMS should include various electrical appliances as well as local distributed/renewable energy resources and energy storage systems, with the whole system as a microgrid. However, the collecting and processing of the data associated with these appliances/resources are challenging in terms of the required sensors/communication infrastructure and computational burden. Thanks to the internet-of-things and cloud computing technologies, the physical requirements for handling the data have been provided; however, they demand suitable optimization/management schemes. In this article, a HAEMS is developed using cloud services to increase the accuracy and speed of the data processing. A management protocol is proposed that provides an optimal schedule for a day-ahead operation of the electrical equipment of smart residential homes under welfare indicators. The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) sensors associated with the home appliances and generation/storage units, (2) local fog nodes, and (3) a cloud where the information is processed bilaterally with HAEMS and the hourly optimal operation of appliances/generation/storage units is planned. The neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) are used as part of the HAEMS program. The neural network is used to predict the amount of workload corresponding to users’ requests. Improving the load factor and the economic efficiency are considered as the objective function that is optimized using GA.

We focused our attention on explaining how different approaches to intelligence (i.e., the intelligence cycle (IC) and the critical thinking process (CTP)) can be combined and linked with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) so that AI/ML is used effectively. A small group interview was undertaken with five senior security managers based in a range of companies, all of whom had extensive security knowledge and industry experience. The findings suggest that organizational learning, transformational leadership, organizational restructuring, crisis management, and corporate intelligence are fundamental components of threat intelligence and provide a basis upon which a cyber threat intelligence cycle process (CTICP) can be developed to aid the resilience building process. The benefit of this is to increase organizational resilience by more firmly integrating the intelligence activities of the business so that a proactive approach to cyber security management is achieved."

Methods: We used secondary data from companies’ reports and statistical yearbooks to identify key stakeholders in the soybean supply chain as well as to explore trade-offs between reducing farming expansion into new agricultural frontiers and increasing investments in agro-industrial sectors. Results: The results reveal that at the global level, multinational corporations along with domestic groups should be held accountable for improving the governance of the soybean supply chain in Brazil since foreign multinationals control 65.4% of it. At the domestic level, losses in Brazil’s farming sector can either be offset by an 11% or 5.2% market share increase in the trading segment or in the whole supply chain, respectively, since Brazilian groups control 93.4% of the farming sector but only 7.1% of the agro-industrial sectors.

A critical step in the treatment and management of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline, with computed tomography (CT) imaging being a particularly effective method for determining the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT images. More specifically, machine-driven design exploration was leveraged to determine a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we build a customized network design tailored for predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) based on a patient’s CT scan, initial spirometry measurement, and clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to study the decision-making behavior of Fibrosis-Net as to verify that predictions are based on relevant visual indicators in CT images. Experiments using a patient cohort from the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge showed that the proposed Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the challenge. Furthermore, explainability-driven performance validation demonstrated that the proposed Fibrosis-Net exhibits correct decision-making behavior by leveraging clinically-relevant visual indicators in CT images when making predictions on pulmonary fibrosis progress. Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge, and has been shown to exhibit correct decision-making behavior when making predictions. Fibrosis-Net is available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the OpenMedAI initiative. While Fibrosis-Net is not yet a production-ready clinical assessment solution, we hope that its release will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon it."

AI technologies facilitate the generation of masses of data that may illuminate existing food-safety and employee-safety risks. These systems may collect incidental data that could be used, or may be designed specifically, to assess and manage risks. The predictions and knowledge generated by these data and technologies may increase company liability and expense, and discourage adoption of these predictive technologies. Such problems may extend beyond the food system to other industries.

In an online study, 127 participants watched a video of a financial AI assistant with varying degrees of decision agency. They generated 358 spontaneous text descriptions of the system and completed standard questionnaires from the Trust in Automation and Technology Acceptance literature (including perceived system competence, understandability, human-likeness, uncanniness, intention of developers, intention to use, and trust). Comparisons between a high trust and a low trust user group revealed significant differences in both open-ended and closed-ended answers. While high trust users characterized the AI assistant as more useful, competent, understandable, and humanlike, low trust users highlighted the system's uncanniness and potential dangers. Manipulating the AI assistant's agency had no influence on trust or intention to use.

The proposed architecture provides the possibility to not only generate ideas but also categorize them and set priorities. With the developed prototype, 760 ideas were generated on the topic of the design of the Gorenjska region’s development plan with eight different temperatures with the OpenAI-GPT-3.5-turbo algorithm. For the set of generated ideas, the entropy was determined, as well as the time needed for their generation. The distributions of the entropy of the ideas generated by the human-generated and the AI-generated sets of ideas of the OpenAI-GPT-3.5–turbo algorithm at different temperatures are provided in the form of histograms. Ideas are presented as word clouds and histograms for the human group and the AI-generated sets. A comparison of the process of generating ideas between the human group and AI was conducted. The statistical Mann-Whitney U-test was performed, which confirmed the significant differences in the average entropy of the generated ideas. Correlations between the length of the generated ideas and the time needed were determined for the human group and AI. The distributions for the time needed and the length of the ideas were determined, which are possible indicators to distinguish between human and artificial processes of generating ideas."

Until present, there exists very little knowledge about DC-AI, and its significance in terms of solving real-world problems remains unexplored in the recent literature. In this technical note, we present the core aspects of DC-AI and MC-AI and discuss their interplay when used to solve some real-world problems. We discuss the potential scenarios/situations that require the integration of DC-AI with MC-AI to solve challenging problems in AI. We performed a case study on a real-world dataset to corroborate the potential of DC-AI in realistic scenarios and to prove its significance over MC-AI when either data are limited or their quality is poor. Afterward, we comprehensively discuss the challenges that currently hinder the realization of DC-AI, and we list promising avenues for future research and development concerning DC-AI. Lastly, we discuss the next-generation computing for DC-AI that can foster DC-AI-related developments and can help transition DC-AI from theory to practice. Our detailed analysis can guide AI practitioners toward exploring the undisclosed potential of DC-AI in the current AI-driven era."

The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

                The present study presents a knowledge-based DSS framework for supporting the decision-maker and handling control decisions related to supply chains.
              
                Methods
                Two binary variables were adopted for denoting at which time point a given task $$i$$
                    i
                   starts and finishes. The scheduling issues are represented through the ontological model and appropriately interpreted using the Java environment. Regarding primary data, digital form of administration using google form platform took precedence over physical administration.
              
                Results
                The findings might not be exact replication of the findings from previous studies that are limited to the influence of information and material flow on the performance of supply chain as there are concerns of what factors constitute information and material flow that need to be identified and considered. However, with the finding of associating factors of information and material flow may need to consider this in managing the flow and the supply chain. Associating factors such as information quality, information visibility, material cost, fund shortage and so on, play a role in information and material flow and the decisions made in an organization.
              
                Conclusions
                Factors associating with information and material flow need to be considered in decision making as well, as the cost in any of the elements affects the flow and this would impede supply chain performance of the organization."

Delays in the supply chain can bring consequences such as the lack of food products by retailers, transporters and manufacturers. Thus, this study aims to examine the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in small- and medium-sized food companies in the central region of Portugal, identifying potential problems and pointing out the respective solutions. For this purpose, the study uses a qualitative methodology through semi-structured interviews. It was found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have a codified supply chain and that generally, these companies have a minimal budget, which requires a constant search for new suppliers that represent a reduction in costs. Moreover, most of the companies surveyed faced unexpected challenges, such as a lack of alternative suppliers. The present paper is original because it studies the supply chain in SMEs in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it allows the ascertainment of practical suggestions for these companies to improve, as well as contributing to the clarification of the literature on the supply chain in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."
