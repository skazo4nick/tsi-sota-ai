2024-02-01,Predicting Autonomous Driving Behavior through Human Factor Considerations in Safety-Critical Events,10.3390/smartcities7010018,"[{'author_name': 'Jamal Raiyn', 'author_slug': 'Jamal Raiyn', 'author_sequence_number': None, 'affiliation': None, 'affiliation_slug': None}]",Smart Cities,Smart Cities,7,2024,MDPI AG,1,460-474,"This paper investigates the ability of autonomous driving systems to predict outcomes by considering human factors like gender, age, and driving experience, particularly in the context of safety-critical events. The primary objective is to equip autonomous vehicles with the capacity to make plausible deductions, handle conflicting data, and adjust their responses in real-time during safety-critical situations. A foundational dataset, which encompasses various driving scenarios such as lane changes, merging, and navigating complex intersections, is employed to enable vehicles to exhibit appropriate behavior and make sound decisions in critical safety events. The deep learning model incorporates personalized cognitive agents for each driver, considering their distinct preferences, characteristics, and requirements. This personalized approach aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving, contributing to the ongoing development of intelligent transportation systems. The efforts made contribute to advancements in safety, efficiency, and overall performance within autonomous driving systems. To describe the causal relationship between external factors like weather conditions and human factors, and safety-critical driver behaviors, various data mining techniques can be applied. One commonly used method is regression analysis. Additionally, correlation analysis is employed to reveal relationships between different factors, helping to identify the strength and direction of their impact on safety-critical driver behavior."

Distributed computing is considered one of the efficient platforms for processing and management of massive amounts of data collected by smart devices. This can be implemented by utilizing multi-agent systems (MASs) with multiple autonomous computational entities by memory and computation capabilities and the possibility of message-passing between them. These systems provide a dynamic and self-adaptive platform for managing distributed large-scale systems, such as the Internet-of-Things (IoTs). Despite, the potential applicability of MASs in smart cities, very few practical systems have been deployed using agent-oriented systems. This research surveys the existing techniques presented in the literature that can be utilized for implementing adaptive multi-agent networks in smart cities. The related literature is categorized based on the steps of designing and controlling these adaptive systems. These steps cover the techniques required to define, monitor, plan, and evaluate the performance of an autonomous MAS. At the end, the challenges and barriers for the utilization of these systems in current smart cities, and insights and directions for future research in this domain, are presented."

Agents imbued with artificial social intelligence will require various capabilities to gather the social data needed to inform an artificial theory of mind of their human counterparts. We draw from social signals theorizing and discuss a framework to guide consideration of core features of artificial social intelligence. We discuss how human social intelligence, and the development of theory of mind, can contribute to the development of artificial social intelligence by forming a foundation on which to help agents model, interpret and predict the behaviors and mental states of humans to support human-agent interaction. Artificial social intelligence will need the processing capabilities to perceive, interpret, and generate combinations of social cues to operate within a human-agent team. Artificial Theory of Mind affords a structure by which a socially intelligent agent could be imbued with the ability to model their human counterparts and engage in effective human-agent interaction. Further, modeling Artificial Theory of Mind can be used by an ASI to support transparent communication with humans, improving trust in agents, so that they may better predict future system behavior based on their understanding of and support trust in artificial socially intelligent agents."

Robot. AI,8,2021,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Collaborative virtual agents help human operators to perform tasks in real-time. For this collaboration to be effective, human operators must appropriately trust the agent(s) they are interacting with. Multiple factors influence trust, such as the context of interaction, prior experiences with automated systems and the quality of the help offered by agents in terms of its transparency and performance. Most of the literature on trust in automation identified the performance of the agent as a key factor influencing trust. However, other work has shown that the behavior of the agent, type of the agent’s errors, and predictability of the agent’s actions can influence the likelihood of the user’s reliance on the agent and efficiency of tasks completion. Our work focuses on how agents’ predictability affects cognitive load, performance and users’ trust in a real-time human-agent collaborative task. We used an interactive aiming task where participants had to collaborate with different agents that varied in terms of their predictability and performance. This setup uses behavioral information (such as task performance and reliance on the agent) as well as standardized survey instruments to estimate participants’ reported trust in the agent, cognitive load and perception of task difficulty. Thirty participants took part in our lab-based study. Our results showed that agents with more predictable behaviors have a more positive impact on task performance, reliance and trust while reducing cognitive workload. In addition, we investigated the human-agent trust relationship by creating models that could predict participants’ trust ratings using interaction data. We found that we could reliably estimate participants’ reported trust in the agents using information related to performance, task difficulty and reliance. This study provides insights on behavioral factors that are the most meaningful to anticipate complacent or distrusting attitudes toward automation. With this work, we seek to pave the way for the development of trust-aware agents capable of responding more appropriately to users by being able to monitor components of the human-agent relationships that are the most salient for trust calibration."

Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Resilience in autonomous agent systems is about having the capacity to anticipate, respond to, adapt to, and recover from adverse and dynamic conditions in complex environments. It is associated with the intelligence possessed by the agents to preserve the functionality or to minimize the impact on functionality through a transformation, reconfiguration, or expansion performed across the system. Enhancing the resilience of systems could pave way toward higher autonomy allowing them to tackle intricate dynamic problems. The state-of-the-art systems have mostly focussed on improving the redundancy of the system, adopting decentralized control architectures, and utilizing distributed sensing capabilities. While machine learning approaches for efficient distribution and allocation of skills and tasks have enhanced the potential of these systems, they are still limited when presented with dynamic environments. To move beyond the current limitations, this paper advocates incorporating counterfactual learning models for agents to enable them with the ability to predict possible future conditions and adjust their behavior. Counterfactual learning is a topic that has recently been gaining attention as a model-agnostic and post-hoc technique to improve explainability in machine learning models. Using counterfactual causality can also help gain insights into unforeseen circumstances and make inferences about the probability of desired outcomes. We propose that this can be used in agent systems as a means to guide and prepare them to cope with unanticipated environmental conditions. This supplementary support for adaptation can enable the design of more intelligent and complex autonomous agent systems to address the multifaceted characteristics of real-world problem domains."

Existing approaches to active fault tolerance in swarms have so far omitted fault diagnosis, however we propose that diagnosis is a feature of active fault tolerance that is necessary if swarms are to obtain long-term autonomy. This paper presents a novel method for fault diagnosis that attempts to imitate some of the observed functions of natural immune system. The results of our simulated experiments show that our system is flexible, scalable, and improves swarm tolerance to various electro-mechanical faults in the cases examined."

""Things"" now range from simple Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices to smart wireless sensors, intelligent wireless sensors and actuators, robotic things, and autonomous vehicles operating in consumer, business, and industrial environments. The emergence of ""intelligent things"" (static or mobile) in collaborative autonomous fleets requires new architectures, connectivity paradigms, trustworthiness frameworks, and platforms for the integration of applications across different business and industrial domains. These new applications accelerate the development of autonomous system design paradigms and the proliferation of the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In IoRT, collaborative robotic things can communicate with other things, learn autonomously, interact safely with the environment, humans and other things, and gain qualities like self-maintenance, self-awareness, self-healing, and fail-operational behavior. IoRT applications can make use of the individual, collaborative, and collective intelligence of robotic things, as well as information from the infrastructure and operating context to plan, implement and accomplish tasks under different environmental conditions and uncertainties. The continuous, real-time interaction with the environment makes perception, location, communication, cognition, computation, connectivity, propulsion, and integration of federated IoRT and digital platforms important components of new-generation IoRT applications. This paper reviews the taxonomy of the IoRT, emphasizing the IoRT intelligent connectivity, architectures, interoperability, and trustworthiness framework, and surveys the technologies that enable the application of the IoRT across different domains to perform missions more efficiently, productively, and completely. The aim is to provide a novel perspective on the IoRT that involves communication among robotic things and humans and highlights the convergence of several technologies and interactions between different taxonomies used in the literature."

Robot. AI,7,2020,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Editorial on the Research Topic Designing Self-Organization in the Physical Realm The design and deployment of decentralized systems can benefit from self-organization as it introduces key features, such as resilience, scalability, and adaptivity to dynamic environments. However, whenever self-organization was demonstrated on physical platforms (e.g., robot swarms), this was performed mostly within controlled laboratory conditions. The real world comes with severe requirements, calling for robust design methodologies, their standardization, and validation via benchmarking toolsets. With this Research Topic, we collect, benchmark, and survey novel approaches to push self-organization toward real-world applications, focusing on embodied artificial systems, such as multi-robot, cyber-physical, and socio-technical systems. We start with six perspective and survey papers that give a good overview of the state of the art and challenges of real-world implementations. Gershenson studies the complexity of cyber-physical systems. After reviewing basic concepts that are useful to design self-organizing systems, he introduces approaches to implement self-organization in cyber-physical systems. Gershenson reviews three case studies from different domains. Crowd control is related to a passive control approach using signs to mediate passenger boarding and descent in Mexico City Metro. In a traffic light case study, traffic lights and vehicles interact closely as agents, resulting in a network of streets and crossings with self-organized coordination of traffic flows. The third case study is related to public transport and addresses the equal headway instability. Trains use bio-inspired pheromone systems to keep equal distance to the vehicles in front and behind. The result is a flexible system where trains can quickly adapt and respond to service delays. Gershenson provides an outlook for cyber-physical and cyber-social systems controlled by guided self-organization. Based on the above-mentioned benefits of self-organization the motivation is strong to apply swarm robotics in industrial applications. However, many industrial applications still rely on centralized control. In cases where a multi-robot solution is employed, the main idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision-making is often not implemented. Schranz et al. provide a collection and categorization of swarm robotic behaviors. The paper gives a comprehensive overview of research platforms and industrial projects and products, separated into terrestrial, aerial, aquatic, and outer space. The authors identify several open issues including dependability, emergent characteristics, security and safety, and communication as hindrances for the implementation of fully distributed autonomous swarm systems."

				 The complexity and dynamics in groupage traffic require flexible, efficient, and adaptive planning and control processes. The general problem of allocating orders to vehicles can be mapped into the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, in practical applications additional requirements complicate the dispatching processes and require a proactive and reactive system behavior. To enable automated dispatching processes, this article presents a multiagent system where the decision making is shifted to autonomous, interacting, intelligent agents. Beside the communication protocols and the agent architecture, the focus is on the individual decision making of the agents which meets the specific requirements in groupage traffic. To evaluate the approach we apply multiagent-based simulation and model several scenarios of real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, a case study is conducted which covers the autonomous groupage traffic in the current processes of our industrial parter. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the sophisticated requirements of groupage traffic. Furthermore, the decision making supports the combination of pickup and delivery tours efficiently while satisfying logistic request priorities, time windows, and capacity constraints."

In a nutshell, given a model of a domain and a set of possible goals, a solution to a GRD problem determines (1) the extent to which actions performed by an agent within the model reveal the agent’s objective; and (2) how best to modify the model so that the objective of an agent can be detected as early as possible. This approach is relevant to any domain in which rapid goal recognition is essential and the model design can be controlled. Applications include intrusion detection, assisted cognition, computer games, and human-robot collaboration.&#x0D;
 A GRD problem has two components: the analyzed goal recognition setting, and a design model specifying the possible ways the environment in which agents act can be modified so as to facilitate recognition. This work formulates a general framework for GRD in deterministic and partially observable environments, and offers a toolbox of solutions for evaluating and optimizing model quality for various settings. &#x0D;
For the purpose of evaluation we suggest the worst case distinctiveness (WCD) measure, which represents the maximal cost of a path an agent may follow before its goal can be inferred by a goal recognition system. We offer novel compilations to classical planning for calculating WCD in settings where agents are bounded-suboptimal. We then suggest methods for minimizing WCD by searching for an optimal redesign strategy within the space of possible modifications, and using pruning to increase efficiency. We support our approach with an empirical evaluation that measures WCD in a variety of GRD settings and tests the efficiency of our compilation-based methods for computing it. We also examine the effectiveness of reducing WCD via redesign and the performance gain brought about by our proposed pruning strategy."

The methodology leverages accessible domains to train an agent to solve navigational problems such as obstacle avoidance and allows the agent to generalize to challenging and inaccessible domains such as those present in marine environments with minimal further training. This is done by integrating a DRL agent at a high level of vehicle control and leveraging existing path planning and proven low-level control methodologies that are utilized in multiple domains. An autonomy package with a tertiary multilevel controller is developed to enable the DRL agent to interface at the prescribed high control level and thus be separated from vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints. An example Deep Q Network (DQN) employing this methodology for obstacle avoidance is trained in a simulated ground environment, and then its ability to generalize across domains is experimentally validated. Experimental validation utilized a simulated water surface environment and real-world deployment of ground and water robotic platforms. This methodology, when used, shows that it is possible to leverage accessible and data rich domains, such as ground, to effectively develop marine DRL agents for use on Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) navigation. This will allow rapid and iterative agent development without the risk of ASV loss, the cost and logistic overhead of marine deployment, and allow landlocked institutions to develop agents for marine applications."

Therefore, current research must start diverting focus from how many agents can a human manage to how can agents and humans work together effectively. Levels of autonomy (LOAs), or varying levels of responsibility given to the agents, implemented specifically in the decision-making process could potentially address some of the issues related to workload, stress, performance, and trust.

Results: Findings revealed only 12 topic-relevant articles from 2013 to 2022, primarily published recently. More recent articles have received more citations than earlier published works. The articles were from multiple research fields, such as business economics, engineering, computer science, and social sciences, with only one article on environmentally sustainable technologies. The top keywords were “warehouse management system”, “internet of things”, “industry 4.0” and “supply chain”. Only six articles had environmental sustainability terms in the keywords. Findings show more discussions about social rather than environmental sustainability. Most studies suggest integrating WMS with other systems to support sustainability efforts in warehousing.

Current mainstream methodologies - optimization and reinforcement learning - suffer from obvious computational drawbacks. Optimization models need to be solved in real-time and often trade off model fidelity (hence quality of solutions) for computational efficiency. Reinforcement learning is expensive to train and often struggles to achieve coordination among a large fleet. This paper designs a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of the two while overcoming their drawbacks. Specifically, it trains an optimization proxy, i.e., a machine-learning model that approximates an optimization model, and then refines the proxy with reinforcement learning. This Reinforcement Learning from Optimization Proxy (RLOP) approach is computationally efficient to train and deploy, and achieves better results than RL or optimization alone. Numerical experiments on the New York City dataset show that the RLOP approach reduces both the relocation costs and computation time significantly compared to the optimization model, while pure reinforcement learning fails to converge due to computational complexity."

It requires both sufficient input data, which can be generated, e.g., by mobile sensors, and adequate prediction methods. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are well suited to solve non-linear and complex relationships in the collected tracking data. Despite that, only a minority of recent publications use ML for travel time prediction in multimodal transports. We apply the ML algorithms extremely randomized trees (ExtraTrees), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) to this problem because of their ability to deal with low data volumes and their low processing times. Using different combinations of features derived from the data, we have built several models for travel time prediction. Tracking data from a real-world multimodal container transport relation from Germany to the USA are used for evaluation of the established models. We show that SVR provides the best prediction accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 17 h for a transport time of up to 30 days. We also show that our model performs better than average-based approaches."

Modern ML models have become more complex, deeper, and harder to reason about. At the same time, the community has started to realize the importance of protecting the privacy of the training data that goes into these models.
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a gold standard for making formal statements about data anonymization. However, while some adoption of DP has happened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are still few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical guidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and the difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility-computation trade-offs for ML models. Tricks for tuning and maximizing performance are scattered among papers or stored in the heads of practitioners, particularly with respect to the challenging task of hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the literature seems to present conflicting evidence on how and whether to apply architectural adjustments and which components are “safe” to use with DP.
In this survey paper, we attempt to create a self-contained guide that gives an in-depth overview of the field of DP ML. We aim to assemble information about achieving the best possible DP ML model with rigorous privacy guarantees. Our target audience is both researchers and practitioners. Researchers interested in DP for ML will benefit from a clear overview of current advances and areas for improvement. We also include theory-focused sections that highlight important topics such as privacy accounting and convergence. For a practitioner, this survey provides a background in DP theory and a clear step-by-step guide for choosing an appropriate privacy definition and approach, implementing DP training, potentially updating the model architecture, and tuning hyperparameters. For both researchers and practitioners, consistently and fully reporting privacy guarantees is critical, so we propose a set of specific best practices for stating guarantees.
With sufficient computation and a sufficiently large training set or supplemental nonprivate data, both good accuracy (that is, almost as good as a non-private model) and good privacy can often be achievable. And even when computation and dataset size are limited, there are advantages to training with even a weak (but still finite) formal DP guarantee. Hence, we hope this work will facilitate more widespread deployments of DP ML models."

Artif. Intell.,4,2021,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Since E. coli is considered a fecal indicator in surface water, government water quality standards and industry guidance often rely on E. coli monitoring to identify when there is an increased risk of pathogen contamination of water used for produce production (e.g., for irrigation). However, studies have indicated that E. coli testing can present an economic burden to growers and that time lags between sampling and obtaining results may reduce the utility of these data. Models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may provide a mechanism for overcoming these obstacles. Thus, this proof-of-concept study uses previously published datasets to train, test, and compare E. coli predictive models using multiple algorithms and performance measures. Since the collection of different feature data carries specific costs for growers, predictive performance was compared for models built using different feature types [geospatial, water quality, stream traits, and/or weather features]. Model performance was assessed against baseline regression models. Model performance varied considerably with root-mean-squared errors and Kendall’s Tau ranging between 0.37 and 1.03, and 0.07 and 0.55, respectively. Overall, models that included turbidity, rain, and temperature outperformed all other models regardless of the algorithm used. Turbidity and weather factors were also found to drive model accuracy even when other feature types were included in the model. These findings confirm previous conclusions that machine learning models may be useful for predicting when, where, and at what level E. coli (and associated hazards) are likely to be present in preharvest agricultural water sources. This study also identifies specific algorithm-predictor combinations that should be the foci of future efforts to develop deployable models (i.e., models that can be used to guide on-farm decision-making and risk mitigation). When deploying E. coli predictive models in the field, it is important to note that past research indicates an inconsistent relationship between E. coli levels and foodborne pathogen presence. Thus, models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may be useful for assessing fecal contamination status and ensuring compliance with regulations but should not be used to assess the risk that specific pathogens of concern (e.g., Salmonella, Listeria) are present."

               Mixed-signal and fully digital neuromorphic systems have been of significant interest for deploying spiking neural networks in an energy-efficient manner. However, many of these systems impose constraints in terms of fan-in, memory, or synaptic weight precision that have to be considered during network design and training. In this paper, we present quantized rewiring (Q-rewiring), an algorithm that can train both spiking and non-spiking neural networks while meeting hardware constraints during the entire training process. To demonstrate our approach, we train both feedforward and recurrent neural networks with a combined fan-in/weight precision limit, a constraint that is, for example, present in the DYNAP-SE mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. Q-rewiring simultaneously performs quantization and rewiring of synapses and synaptic weights through gradient descent updates and projecting the trainable parameters to a constraint-compliant region. Using our algorithm, we find trade-offs between the number of incoming connections to neurons and network performance for a number of common benchmark datasets."

In this paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model is presented for designing a sustainable closed-loop supply chain. The model is aimed at the minimization of the total cost with the total used facilities, the negative environmental impacts, and the maximization of the positive social impacts. Methods: The epsilon-constraint method is utilized for solving the model and further extracting the Pareto solutions. Results: The result of the research clearly shows an optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives, where, by paying more attention to the social and environmental aspects of sustainability, the total costs are increased or by optimizing the number of facilities, a better balance between the dynamics associated with the short-term and long-term goals is reached. The results of the sensitivity analysis also show that increasing the demand of the supply chain has the greatest impact on the supply chain costs compared to other objectives. Conclusions: Consequently, investigating such comprehensive sustainable objectives provides better insights into the impact of design variables on the expectations of stakeholders."

The information collected by the sensors can also be used to estimate and predict product failures, thereby helping to improve maintenance operations. This paper describes a study in which system maintenance and EOL processes were combined and closed-loop supply chain systems were constructed to analyze the financial contribution that sensors can make to these procedures by using discrete event simulation to model and compare regular systems and sensor-embedded systems. The factors that had an impact on the performance measures, such as disassembly cost, maintenance cost, inspection cost, sales revenues, and profitability, were determined and a design of experiments study was carried out. The experiment results were compared, and pairwise t-tests were executed. The results reveal that sensor-embedded systems are significantly superior to regular systems in terms of the identified performance measures."

The complexity of the fertilizer supply chain motivated us to carry out this study on redesigning the fertilizer logistics chain and evaluate strategies for reducing logistics costs by redesigning the fertilizer mixing network in Brazil, a country that is heavily dependent on imported fertilizers for agriculture. Methods: We introduce a multi-product mixed-integer linear programming optimization model encompassing the logistics network, from import ports to mixing factories and agricultural fertilizer supply centers. This model includes logistics infrastructure and taxes, accounting for greenhouse gas emissions (specifically carbon dioxide) in fertilizer logistics. Results: The results indicate that expanding the port capacity for fertilizer importation can significantly reduce logistics costs and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 22.5%, decreasing by 23.9% compared to the baseline. We also observed that removing taxes on fertilizer importation can reduce logistics costs by approximately 11%, but it increases greenhouse gas emissions by 2.25% due to increased reliance on road transport. We identified 15 highly resilient regions for establishing mixing factories, evaluated various scenarios and determined the importance of these locations in optimizing the fertilizer supply network in the country. Moreover, the results suggest a significant potential to enhance the role of Brazil’s Northern Arc region in fertilizer import flows. Conclusions: Public policies and private initiatives could be directed toward encouraging the establishment of mixing factories in the identified regions and increasing transport capacity in the Northern Arc region. Improving the logistical conditions of the fertilizer network would contribute to food security by reducing the costs of essential inputs in food production and promoting sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

We demonstrate superior performance of DeepLORI in a comparison with several existing methods. Moreover, we show that DeepLORI-based predictions can be interpreted on the level of individual patients. Using a game theoretic approach, we identify relevant features in DeepLORI models and demonstrate that model predictions are explainable in light of existing knowledge about the disease. Finally, we validate the model on independent data from around 97,000 patients, showing good generalization and stable prediction performance over time."

               In this critical review, we examine the application of predictive models, e.g. classifiers, trained using Machine Learning (ML) to assist in interpretation of functional neuroimaging data. Our primary goal is to summarize how ML is being applied and critically assess common practices. Our review covers 250 studies published using ML and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to infer various dimensions of the human functional connectome. Results for hold-out (“lockbox”) performance was, on average, ~13% less accurate than performance measured through cross-validation alone, highlighting the importance of lockbox data which was included in only 16% of the studies. There was also a concerning lack of transparency across the key steps in training and evaluating predictive models. The summary of this literature underscores the importance of the use of a lockbox and highlights several methodological pitfalls that can be addressed by the imaging community. We argue that, ideally, studies are motivated both by the reproducibility and generalizability of findings as well as the potential clinical significance of the insights. We offer recommendations for principled integration of machine learning into the clinical neurosciences with the goal of advancing imaging biomarkers of brain disorders, understanding causative determinants for health risks, and parsing heterogeneous patient outcomes."

Proven to be conveniently efficient and cost-effective, chest X-ray (CXR) has become the preliminary medical imaging tool for detecting TB. Arguably, the quality of TB diagnosis will improve vastly with automated CXRs for TB detection and the localization of suspected areas, which may manifest TB. The current line of research aims to develop an efficient computer-aided detection system that will support doctors (and radiologists) to become well-informed when making TB diagnosis from patients' CXRs. Here, an integrated process to improve TB diagnostics via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and localization in CXRs via deep-learning models is proposed. Three key steps in the TB diagnostics process include (a) modifying CNN model structures, (b) model fine-tuning via artificial bee colony algorithm, and (c) the implementation of linear average-based ensemble method. Comparisons of the overall performance are made across all three steps among the experimented deep CNN models on two publicly available CXR datasets, namely, the Shenzhen Hospital CXR dataset and the National Institutes of Health CXR dataset. Validated performance includes detecting CXR abnormalities and differentiating among seven TB-related manifestations (consolidation, effusion, fibrosis, infiltration, mass, nodule, and pleural thickening).

This advance is mostly owed to the ability of deep learning algorithms, that is, artificial neural networks with multiple processing layers, to model complex nonlinear inputoutput relationships, and perform pattern recognition and feature extraction from low-level data representations. Certain deep learning models have been shown to match or even exceed the performance of the familiar existing machine learning and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods for drug discovery 4-6. Moreover, deep learning has boosted the potential and broadened the applicability of computer-assisted discovery, for example, in molecular design 7,8 , chemical synthesis planning 9,10 , protein structure prediction 11 and macromolecular target identification 12,13. The ability to capture intricate nonlinear relationships between input data (for example, chemical structure representations) and the associated output (for example, assay readout) often comes at the price of limited comprehensibility of the resulting model. While there have been efforts to explain QSARs in terms of algorithmic insights and molecular descriptor analysis 14-19 , deep neural network models notoriously elude immediate accessibility by the human mind 20. In medicinal chemistry in particular, the availability of 'rules of thumb' correlating biological effects with physicochemical properties underscores the willingness, in certain situations, to sacrifice accuracy in favour of models that better fit human intuition 21-23. Thus, blurring the lines between the 'two QSARs' 24 (that is, mechanistically interpretable versus highly accurate models) may be key to accelerated drug discovery with AI 25. Automated analysis of medical and chemical knowledge to extract and represent features in a human-intelligible format dates back to the 1990s 26,27 , but has been receiving increasing attention due to the re-emergence of neural networks in chemistry and healthcare. Given the current pace of AI in drug discovery and related fields, there will be an increased demand for methods that help us understand and interpret the underlying models. In an effort to mitigate the lack of interpretability of certain machine learning models, and to augment human reasoning and decision-making, 28 , attention has been drawn to explainable AI (XAI) approaches 29,30. Providing informative explanations alongside the mathematical models aims to (1) render the underlying decision-making process transparent ('understandable') 31 , (2) avoid correct predictions for the wrong reasons (the so-called clever Hans effect) 32 , (3) avert unfair biases or unethical discrimination 33 and (4) bridge the gap between the machine learning community and other scientific disciplines.

Depending on the problem scenarios and the available Decision Makers (DMs), such RL algorithms may be designed for single-agent systems or multi-agent systems that either consist of agents with individual goals and decision making capabilities, which are influenced by other agent’s decisions, or behave as a swarm of agents that collaboratively learn a single objective. Many studies have been conducted in this area; however, when concentrating on available swarm RL algorithms, one obtains a clear view of the areas that still require attention. Most of the studies in this area focus on homogeneous swarms and so far, systems introduced as Heterogeneous Swarms (HetSs) merely include very few, i.e., two or three sub-swarms of homogeneous agents, which either, according to their capabilities, deal with a specific sub-problem of the general problem or exhibit different behaviors in order to reduce the risk of bias. This study introduces a novel approach that allows agents, which are originally designed to solve different problems and hence have higher degrees of heterogeneity, to behave as a swarm when addressing identical sub-problems. In fact, the affinity between two agents, which measures the compatibility of agents to work together towards solving a specific sub-problem, is used in designing a Heterogeneous Swarm RL (HetSRL) algorithm that allows HetSs to solve the intended SDMPs."

In FPO, all of the particles are seen as predators. Only the competitive, powerful predator that are selected as an elite could achieve the limited opportunity to update. The elite generation with roulette wheel selection could increase individual independence and reduce rapid social collaboration. Experimental results show that FPO is able to provide excellent performance of global exploration and local minima avoidance simultaneously. However, to the higher dimensionality of multimodal problem, the slow convergence speed becomes the bottleneck of FPO. A dynamic team model is utilized in FPO, named DFPO to accelerate the early convergence rate. In this paper, DFPO is more precisely described and its variant, DFPO-r is proposed to improve the performance of DFPO. A method of team size selection is proposed in DFPO-r to increase population diversity. The population diversity is one of the most important factors that determines the performance of the optimization algorithm. A higher degree of population diversity is able to help DFPO-r alleviate a premature convergence. The strategy of selection is to choose team size according to the higher degree of population diversity. Ten well-known multimodal benchmark functions are used to evaluate the solution capability of DFPO and DFPO-r. Six benchmark functions are extensively set to 100 dimensions to investigate the performance of DFPO and DFPO-r compared with LBest PSO, Dolphin Partner Optimization and FPO. Experimental results show that both DFPO and DFPO-r could demonstrate the desirable performance. Furthermore, DFPO-r shows better robustness performance compared with DFPO in experimental study."

However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems."

AI,7,2020,Frontiers Media SA,,,"The real world is highly variable and unpredictable, and so fine-tuned robot controllers that successfully result in group-level ""emergence"" of swarm capabilities indoors may quickly become inadequate outside. One response to unpredictability could be greater robot complexity and cost, but this seems counter to the ""swarm philosophy"" of deploying (very) large numbers of simple agents. Instead, here I argue that bioinspiration in swarm robotics has considerable untapped potential in relation to the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity: when a genotype can produce a range of distinctive changes in organismal behavior, physiology and morphology in response to different environments. This commonly arises following a natural history of variable conditions; implying the need for more diverse and hazardous simulated environments in offline, pre-deployment optimization of swarms. This will generate-indicate the need for-plasticity. Biological plasticity is sometimes irreversible; yet this characteristic remains relevant in the context of minimal swarms, where robots may become mass-producible. Plasticity can be introduced through the greater use of adaptive threshold-based behaviors; more fundamentally, it can link to emerging technologies such as smart materials, which can adapt form and function to environmental conditions. Moreover, in social animals, individual heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as functional for the group. Phenotypic plasticity can provide meaningful diversity ""for free"" based on early, local sensory experience, contributing toward better collective decision-making and resistance against adversarial agents, for example. Nature has already solved the challenge of resilient self-organisation in the physical realm through phenotypic plasticity: swarm engineers can follow this lead."

AI,4,2017,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Swarm robotics has experienced a rapid expansion in recent years, primarily fueled by specialized multi-robot systems developed to achieve dedicated collective actions. These specialized platforms are, in general, designed with swarming considerations at the front and center. Key hardware and software elements required for swarming are often deeply embedded and integrated with the particular system. However, given the noticeable increase in the number of low-cost mobile robots readily available, practitioners and hobbyists may start considering to assemble full-fledged swarms by minimally retrofitting such mobile platforms with a swarm-enabling technology. Here, we report one possible embodiment of such a technology-an integrated combination of hardware and software-designed to enable the assembly and the study of swarming in a range of general-purpose robotic systems. This is achieved by combining a modular and transferable software toolbox with a hardware suite composed of a collection of low-cost and off-theshelf components. The developed technology can be ported to a relatively vast range of robotic platforms-such as land and surface vehicles-with minimal changes and high levels of scalability. This swarm-enabling technology has successfully been implemented on two distinct distributed multi-robot systems, a swarm of mobile marine buoys and a team of commercial terrestrial robots. We have tested the effectiveness of both of these distributed robotic systems in performing collective exploration and search scenarios, as well as other classical cooperative behaviors. Experimental results on different swarm behaviors are reported for the two platforms in uncontrolled environments and without any supporting infrastructure. The design of the associated software library allows for a seamless switch to other cooperative behaviors-e.g., leader-follower heading consensus and collision avoidance, and also offers the possibility to simulate newly designed collective behaviors prior to their implementation onto the platforms. This feature greatly facilitates behavior-based design, i.e., the design of new swarming behaviors, with the possibility to simulate them prior to physically test them."

Moreover, these models necessitate a tight coupling with the deployment scenarios to induce consistent swarm behaviors. Here, we propose a predictive model that combines the local principles of potential field models with the knowledge of the agents' dynamics. We show that our approach improves the speed, order, and safety of the swarm, it is independent of the environment layout, and scalable in the swarm speed and inter-agent distance. Our model is validated with a swarm of five quadrotors that can successfully navigate in a real-world indoor environment populated with obstacles."

While current swarm implementations can be large in size (e.g., 1,000 robots), they are typically constrained to working in highly controlled indoor environments. Moreover, a common property of swarms is the underlying assumption that the robots act in close proximity of each other (e.g., 10 body lengths apart), and typically employ uninterrupted, situated, close-range communication for coordination. Many real world applications, including environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, however, require scalable groups of robots to act jointly over large distances (e.g., 1,000 body lengths), rendering the use of dense swarms impractical. Using a dense swarm for such applications would be invasive to the environment and unrealistic in terms of mission deployment, maintenance and post-mission recovery. To address this problem, we propose the sparse swarm concept, and illustrate its use in the context of four application scenarios. For one scenario, which requires a group of rovers to traverse, and monitor, a forest environment, we identify the challenges involved at all levels in developing a sparse swarm-from the hardware platform to communication-constrained coordination algorithms-and discuss potential solutions. We outline open questions of theoretical and practical nature, which we hope will bring the concept of sparse swarms to fruition."

Next, design pattern application rules that can facilitate the pattern usage in robot control algorithms are given. A catalogue of six design patterns is then presented. The patterns are derived from an extensive list of experiments reported in the swarm robotics literature, demonstrating the capability of the proposed method to identify distinguishing features of robot behaviour and their impact on swarm performance in a wide range of swarm implementations and experimental scenarios. Each pattern features a detailed description of robot behaviour and its associated parameters, facilitated by the usage of a multi-agent modeling language, BDRML, and an account of feedback loops and forces that affect the pattern's applicability. Scenarios in which the pattern has been used are described. The consequences of each design pattern on overall swarm performance are characterised within the Information-Cost-Reward framework, that makes it possible to formally relate the way in which robots acquire, share and utilise information.

Next, we review an early augmented reality prototype for designing and projecting biohybrid system simulations into real space. In addition to models that retrace plant behaviors, we specify swarm grammar agents to braid structures in a self-organizing manner. Based on this model, both robotic and plant-driven braiding processes can be experienced and explored in virtual worlds. We present an according user interface for use in virtual reality. As we present interactive models concerning rather diverse description levels, we only ensured their principal capacity for interaction but did not consider efficiency analyzes beyond prototypic operation. We conclude this article with an outlook on future works on melding reality and virtuality to drive the design and deployment of biohybrid systems.Keywords: biohybrid systems, augmented reality, virtual reality, user interfaces, biological development, generative systems Biohybrid systems, i.e., the cross-fertilization of robotic entities and plants, take robotic control and interconnected technologies a significant step beyond the design, planning, manufacture, and supply of complex products. Instead of pre-defined blueprints and manufacturing processes that fulfill certain target specifications, biohybrid systems consider, even make use of the variability of living organisms. By promoting and guiding the growth and development of plants, the characteristics exhibited throughout their life cycles become part of the system-from esthetic greenery over loadbearing and energy-saving structural elements to the potential supply of nourishment. At the same time, biohybrid systems are feedback-controlled systems which means that (1) deviations of the individual plant, e.g., in terms of its health or developmental state, or (2) unexpected environmental trends, e.g., in terms of climatic conditions or regarding changes in the built environment, as well as (3) changes in the target specifications, can be compensated for. These traits of robustness, adaptivity, and flexibility in combination with a potential longevity that may easily outlast a human lifetime, may very well render biohybrid systems a key technology in shaping the evolution of man-kind.

Robot. AI,3,2016,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Intelligent embodied robots are integrated systems: as they move continuously through their environments, executing behaviors and carrying out tasks, components for low-level and high-level intelligence are integrated in the robot's cognitive system, and cognitive and physical processes combine to create their behavior. For a modeling framework to enable the design and analysis of such integrated intelligence, the underlying representations in the design of the robot should be dynamically sensitive, capable of reflecting both continuous motion and micro-cognitive influences, while also directly representing the necessary beliefs and intentions for goal-directed behavior. In this paper, a dynamical intention-based modeling framework is presented that satisfies these criteria, along with a hybrid dynamical cognitive agent (HDCA) framework for employing dynamical intentions in embodied agents. This dynamical intention-HDCA (DI-HDCA) modeling framework is a fusion of concepts from spreading activation networks, hybrid dynamical system models, and the BDI (belief-desire-intention) theory of goal-directed reasoning, adapted and employed unconventionally to meet entailments of environment and embodiment. The paper presents two kinds of autonomous agent learning results that demonstrate dynamical intentions and the multi-faceted integration they enable in embodied robots: with a simulated service robot in a grid-world office environment, reactive-level learning minimizes reliance on deliberative-level intelligence, enabling task sequencing and action selection to be distributed over both deliberative and reactive levels; and with a simulated game of Tag, the cognitive-physical integration of an autonomous agent enables the straightforward learning of a user-specified strategy during gameplay, without interruption to the game. In addition, the paper argues that dynamical intentions are consistent with cognitive theory underlying goal-directed behavior, and that DI-HDCA modeling may facilitate the study of emergent behaviors in embodied agents."

Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Resilience in autonomous agent systems is about having the capacity to anticipate, respond to, adapt to, and recover from adverse and dynamic conditions in complex environments. It is associated with the intelligence possessed by the agents to preserve the functionality or to minimize the impact on functionality through a transformation, reconfiguration, or expansion performed across the system. Enhancing the resilience of systems could pave way toward higher autonomy allowing them to tackle intricate dynamic problems. The state-of-the-art systems have mostly focussed on improving the redundancy of the system, adopting decentralized control architectures, and utilizing distributed sensing capabilities. While machine learning approaches for efficient distribution and allocation of skills and tasks have enhanced the potential of these systems, they are still limited when presented with dynamic environments. To move beyond the current limitations, this paper advocates incorporating counterfactual learning models for agents to enable them with the ability to predict possible future conditions and adjust their behavior. Counterfactual learning is a topic that has recently been gaining attention as a model-agnostic and post-hoc technique to improve explainability in machine learning models. Using counterfactual causality can also help gain insights into unforeseen circumstances and make inferences about the probability of desired outcomes. We propose that this can be used in agent systems as a means to guide and prepare them to cope with unanticipated environmental conditions. This supplementary support for adaptation can enable the design of more intelligent and complex autonomous agent systems to address the multifaceted characteristics of real-world problem domains."

In nature, however, many multi-agent systems exhibit a more complex collective behavior involving a certain level of competition. One representative example of complex collective behavior is a multi-ball Bernoulli-ball system. In this paper, by extracting local force among the Bernoulli balls, we approximated the state-transfer model mapping interaction forces to observed behaviors. The results show that the collective Bernoulli-ball system spent 41% of its time on competitive behaviors, in which up to 84% of the interaction state is unorganized. The rest 59% of the time is spent on collaborative behavior. We believe that the novel proposed model opens new avenues in swarm robotics research."

We bring together our previous work on Buzz, the swarm-oriented programming language, and the many contributions of the Robotic Operating System (ROS) community into a reliable workflow, from rapid prototyping of decentralized behaviors up to robust field deployment. The Buzz programming language is a hardware independent, domain-specific (swarm-oriented), and composable language. From simulation to the field, a Buzz script can stay unmodified and almost seamlessly applicable to all units of a heterogeneous robotic team. We present the software structure of our solution, and the swarm-oriented paradigms it encompasses. While the design of a new behavior can be achieved on a lightweight simulator, we show how our security mechanisms enhance field deployment robustness. In addition, developers can update their scripts in the field using a safe software release mechanism. Integrating Buzz in ROS, adding safety mechanisms and granting field updates are core contributions essential to swarm robotics deployment: from simulation to the field. We show the applicability of our work with the implementation of two practical decentralized scenarios: a robust generic task allocation strategy and an optimized area coverage algorithm. Both behaviors are explained and tested with simulations, then experimented with heterogeneous ground-and-air robotic teams."

To tackle this problem, it is possible (i) to act on the supply side, increasing the number of roads or lanes in a network, (ii) to reduce the demand, restricting the access to urban areas at specific hours or to specific vehicles, or (iii) to improve the efficiency of the existing network, by means of a widespread use of so-called Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In line with the recent advances in smart transportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising field of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, multiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and implementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby generating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms for the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the management of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous vehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact with the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the road network. Building on the reservationbased intersection control model proposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for the allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers' route choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy."

				 The complexity and dynamics in groupage traffic require flexible, efficient, and adaptive planning and control processes. The general problem of allocating orders to vehicles can be mapped into the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, in practical applications additional requirements complicate the dispatching processes and require a proactive and reactive system behavior. To enable automated dispatching processes, this article presents a multiagent system where the decision making is shifted to autonomous, interacting, intelligent agents. Beside the communication protocols and the agent architecture, the focus is on the individual decision making of the agents which meets the specific requirements in groupage traffic. To evaluate the approach we apply multiagent-based simulation and model several scenarios of real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, a case study is conducted which covers the autonomous groupage traffic in the current processes of our industrial parter. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the sophisticated requirements of groupage traffic. Furthermore, the decision making supports the combination of pickup and delivery tours efficiently while satisfying logistic request priorities, time windows, and capacity constraints."

Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if they can use -and even create -opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.In this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential optimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We present a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined) accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our formulations simultaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them to find solutions significantly faster (orders of magnitude faster in larger problems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically."

We extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with N agents and C resources. We show that for any convention, there exists a symmetric subgame-perfect equilibrium which implements it. We present two conventions: bourgeois, where agents stick to the first allocation; and market, where agents pay for the use of resources, and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocations. We define price of anonymity of a convention as a ratio between the maximum social payoff of any (asymmetric) strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the subgame-perfect equilibrium which implements the convention. We show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite, the market convention decreases this price by reducing the conflict between the agents."

Robot. AI,6,2019,Frontiers Media SA,,,"This study focuses on category formation for individual agents and the dynamics of symbol emergence in a multi-agent system through semiotic communication. Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system (i.e., agent society) is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, i.e., the complete system can be regarded as a single agent performing multimodal categorization using the sensors of all agents, if we define the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence, i.e., forming and sharing signs and categories, is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the real-world environment. In the experiment, we compared three communication algorithms: no communication, no rejection, and the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher who would know a pre-existing symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system can form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing categories."

Consensus as the most important issue in MAS, much progress has been made in studying the consensus control of MAS, but there are some problems remained largely unaddressed which cause the MAS to lose some useful network structure information. First, multi-agent consensus protocol usually proceeds over the low-order structure by only considering the direct edges between agents, but ignores the higher-order structure of the whole topology network. Second, the existing work assumes all the edges in a topology network have the same weight without exploring the potential diversity of the connections. In this way, multi-agent systems fail to enforce consensus, resulting in fragmentation into multiple clusters. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Motif-aware Weighted Multi-agent System (MWMS) method for consensus control. We focus more on triangle motif in the network, but it can be extended to other kinds of motifs as well. First, a novel weighted network is used which is the combination of the edge-based lower-order structure and the motif-based higher-order structure, i.e., hybrid-order structure. Subsequently, by simultaneously considering the quantity and the quality of the connections in the network, a novel consensus framework for MAS is designed to update agents. Then, two baseline consensus algorithms are used in MWMS. In our experiments, we use ten topologies of different shapes, densities and ranges to comprehensively analyze the performance of our proposed algorithms. The simulation results show that the hybrid higher-order network can effectively enhance the consensus of the multi-agent system in different network topologies."

Their effectiveness in accomplishing these tasks rests upon the design of cooperative control strategies, which is acknowledged to be challenging and nontrivial. In particular, the effectiveness of these strategies has been shown to be related to the so-called exploration–exploitation dilemma: i.e., the existence of a distinct balance between exploitative actions and exploratory ones while the system is operating. Recent results point to the need for a dynamic exploration–exploitation balance to unlock high levels of flexibility, adaptivity, and swarm intelligence. This important point is especially apparent when dealing with fast-changing environments. Problems involving dynamic environments have been dealt with by different scientific communities using theory, simulations, as well as large-scale experiments. Such results spread across a range of disciplines can hinder one’s ability to understand and manage the intricacies of the exploration–exploitation challenge. In this review, we summarize and categorize the methods used to control the level of exploration and exploitation carried out by an multi-agent systems. Lastly, we discuss the critical need for suitable metrics and benchmark problems to quantitatively assess and compare the levels of exploration and exploitation, as well as the overall performance of a system with a given cooperative control algorithm."

				 The complexity and dynamics in groupage traffic require flexible, efficient, and adaptive planning and control processes. The general problem of allocating orders to vehicles can be mapped into the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, in practical applications additional requirements complicate the dispatching processes and require a proactive and reactive system behavior. To enable automated dispatching processes, this article presents a multiagent system where the decision making is shifted to autonomous, interacting, intelligent agents. Beside the communication protocols and the agent architecture, the focus is on the individual decision making of the agents which meets the specific requirements in groupage traffic. To evaluate the approach we apply multiagent-based simulation and model several scenarios of real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, a case study is conducted which covers the autonomous groupage traffic in the current processes of our industrial parter. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the sophisticated requirements of groupage traffic. Furthermore, the decision making supports the combination of pickup and delivery tours efficiently while satisfying logistic request priorities, time windows, and capacity constraints."

The multi-robot system (MRS) is an important carrier for implementing an intelligent warehouse, which completes various tasks in the warehouse through cooperation and coordination between robots. As an extension of reinforcement learning and a kind of swarm intelligence, MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning) can effectively create the multi-robot systems in intelligent warehouses. However, MARL-based multi-robot systems in intelligent warehouses face serious safety issues, such as collisions, conflicts, and congestion. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a safe MARL method based on runtime verification, i.e., an optimized safety policy-generation framework, for multi-robot systems in intelligent warehouses. The framework consists of three stages. In the first stage, a runtime model SCMG (safety-constrained Markov Game) is defined for the multi-robot system at runtime in the intelligent warehouse. In the second stage, rPATL (probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with rewards) is used to express safety properties, and SCMG is cyclically verified and refined through runtime verification (RV) to ensure safety. This stage guarantees the safety of robots’ behaviors before training. In the third stage, the verified SCMG guides SCPO (safety-constrained policy optimization) to obtain an optimized safety policy for robots. Finally, a multi-robot warehouse (RWARE) scenario is used for experimental evaluation. The results show that the policy obtained by our framework is safer than existing frameworks and includes a certain degree of optimization."

Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if they can use -and even create -opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.In this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential optimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We present a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined) accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our formulations simultaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them to find solutions significantly faster (orders of magnitude faster in larger problems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically."

It is a dynamic mixed-integer linear programming model for cost minimization of a three-echelon supply chain serving multiple sites with multiple products over a time horizon. Its novelty lies in yielding optimal decisions on network design, product quantities to be purchased and transported, shipments and inventory levels in all echelons under any logistics system in a multi-period, multi-product and multi-project environment with discount schemes and strategic preferences. The model is general enough to be implemented by any general contractor acting as a system integrator but also allows customization with logical constraints.

In nature, however, many multi-agent systems exhibit a more complex collective behavior involving a certain level of competition. One representative example of complex collective behavior is a multi-ball Bernoulli-ball system. In this paper, by extracting local force among the Bernoulli balls, we approximated the state-transfer model mapping interaction forces to observed behaviors. The results show that the collective Bernoulli-ball system spent 41% of its time on competitive behaviors, in which up to 84% of the interaction state is unorganized. The rest 59% of the time is spent on collaborative behavior. We believe that the novel proposed model opens new avenues in swarm robotics research."

It ignores the fact that in outdoor spaces, microclimate factors tend to have a more important impact on human behavior. In this study, microclimate factors were narrowed down into two main factors: outdoor thermal perception and sunshine perception. Both of these factors are integrated into the traditional MAS, together with visual perception as the influence factors of agent action. The new MAS was developed in Processing language and can dynamically and visually show agents activities in the space. Taking Gulou Square in Nanjing, China, as a case, the simulations were carried out with three typical meteorological days of spring equinox, summer solstice, and winter solstice.

Trading of electricity can be done in spot and derivatives markets, or by bilateral contracts. This article focuses on CECs. Specifically, it presents how agent-based local consumers can form alliances as CECs, manage their resources, and trade on EMs. It also presents a review of how agent-based systems can model and support the formation and interaction of alliances in the electricity sector.

Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (RL) solves complex tasks that require coordination with other agents through autonomous exploration of the environment. However, learning a complex task from scratch is impractical due to the huge sample complexity of RL algorithms. For this reason, reusing knowledge that can come from previous experience or other agents is indispensable to scale up multiagent RL algorithms. This survey provides a unifying view of the literature on knowledge reuse in multiagent RL. We define a taxonomy of solutions for the general knowledge reuse problem, providing a comprehensive discussion of recent progress on knowledge reuse in Multiagent Systems (MAS) and of techniques for knowledge reuse across agents (that may be actuating in a shared environment or not). We aim at encouraging the community to work towards reusing all the knowledge sources available in a MAS. For that, we provide an in-depth discussion of current lines of research and open questions.&#x0D;

However, in a situated setting the non-verbal mode is crucial for an agent to adapt flexible communication strategies. In this work, we focus on learning to generate non-verbal communicative expressions in situated embodied interactive agents. Specifically, we show that an agent can learn pointing gestures in a physically simulated environment through a combination of imitation and reinforcement learning that achieves high motion naturalness and high referential accuracy. We compared our proposed system against several baselines in both subjective and objective evaluations. The subjective evaluation is done in a virtual reality setting where an embodied referential game is played between the user and the agent in a shared 3D space, a setup that fully assesses the communicative capabilities of the generated gestures. The evaluations show that our model achieves a higher level of referential accuracy and motion naturalness compared to a state-of-the-art supervised learning motion synthesis model, showing the promise of our proposed system that combines imitation and reinforcement learning for generating communicative gestures. Additionally, our system is robust in a physically-simulated environment thus has the potential of being applied to robots."

In this model, the DA is “processed” to not only gather data and extend existing knowledge, but also to learn how to act autonomously with its own specific procedures or even to create new ones. An application is given in cases where such rich human–machine interactions are expected to allow the DA+S partnership to acquire deep anticipation capabilities for possible future changes, e.g., to prevent risks or seize opportunities. The way the social organization S operates over time, including the construction of DA, is described using the conceptual framework comprising “memory evolutive systems” (MES), a mathematical theoretical approach introduced by Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch for evolutionary multi-scale, multi-agent and multi-temporality systems.

Methods: In this research paper, we propose a mixed-integer linear formulation for the DMS-p-MP, which captures the key features of the problem and allows for efficient solution methods. The DMS-p-MP adds two key features to the classical problem: (1) it considers the dynamic nature of the problem, where the demand is uncertain and changes over time, and (2) it allows for the modification of the facility locations over time, subject to a fixed number of modifications. The proposed model uses robust optimization in order to address the uncertainty of demand by allowing for the optimization of solutions that are not overly sensitive to small changes in the data or parameters. To manage the computational challenges presented by large-scale DMS-p-MP networks, a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is employed. Results: Our computational study in a real-life case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in solving the DMS p-Median Problem. The results show that the number of opened and closed buildings remains unchanged as the time horizon increases due to the periodic nature of our demand. Conclusions: This formulation can be applied to real-world problems, providing decision-makers with an effective tool to optimize their supply chain network design in a dynamic and uncertain environment."

Current mainstream methodologies - optimization and reinforcement learning - suffer from obvious computational drawbacks. Optimization models need to be solved in real-time and often trade off model fidelity (hence quality of solutions) for computational efficiency. Reinforcement learning is expensive to train and often struggles to achieve coordination among a large fleet. This paper designs a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of the two while overcoming their drawbacks. Specifically, it trains an optimization proxy, i.e., a machine-learning model that approximates an optimization model, and then refines the proxy with reinforcement learning. This Reinforcement Learning from Optimization Proxy (RLOP) approach is computationally efficient to train and deploy, and achieves better results than RL or optimization alone. Numerical experiments on the New York City dataset show that the RLOP approach reduces both the relocation costs and computation time significantly compared to the optimization model, while pure reinforcement learning fails to converge due to computational complexity."

These techniques have garnered strong interest for the analysis of the large, multi-domain open science datasets that are increasingly available in health research. Discovery science in large datasets is challenging given the unconstrained nature of the learning environment where there may be a large number of potential predictors and appropriate ranges for model hyperparameters are unknown. As well, it is likely that explainability is at a premium in order to engage in future hypothesis generation or analysis. Here, we present a novel method that addresses these challenges by exploiting evolutionary algorithms to optimize machine learning discovery science while exploring a large solution space and minimizing bias. We demonstrate that our approach, called integrated evolutionary learning (IEL), provides an automated, adaptive method for jointly learning features and hyperparameters while furnishing explainable models where the original features used to make predictions may be obtained even with artificial neural networks. In IEL the machine learning algorithm of choice is nested inside an evolutionary algorithm which selects features and hyperparameters over generations on the basis of an information function to converge on an optimal solution. We apply IEL to three gold standard machine learning algorithms in challenging, heterogenous biobehavioral data: deep learning with artificial neural networks, decision tree-based techniques and baseline linear models. Using our novel IEL approach, artificial neural networks achieved ≥ 95% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity and 45–73% R2 in classification and substantial gains over default settings. IEL may be applied to a wide range of less- or unconstrained discovery science problems where the practitioner wishes to jointly learn features and hyperparameters in an adaptive, principled manner within the same algorithmic process. This approach offers significant flexibility, enlarges the solution space and mitigates bias that may arise from manual or semi-manual hyperparameter tuning and feature selection and presents the opportunity to select the inner machine learning algorithm based on the results of optimized learning for the problem at hand."

Although model performance is a key criterion for real-time video analysis use cases, inference latency plays a more crucial role in adopting such technology in real-world scenarios. Our objective is to reduce the inference latency of the solution while admissibly maintaining the vision transformer’s performance. Thus, we employed the optimal cloud components as the foundation of our machine learning pipeline and optimized the topology of vision transformers. We utilized UCF101, including more than one million action recognition video clips. The modeling pipeline consists of a preprocessing module to extract frames from video clips, training two-dimensional (2D) vision transformer models, and deep learning baselines. The pipeline also includes a postprocessing step to aggregate the frame-level predictions to generate the video-level predictions at inference. The results demonstrate that our optimal vision transformer model with an input dimension of 56 × 56 × 3 with eight attention heads produces an F1 score of 91.497% for the testing set. The optimized vision transformer reduces the inference latency by 40.70%, measured through a batch-processing approach, with a 55.63% faster training time than the baseline. Lastly, we developed an enhanced skip-frame approach to improve the inference latency by finding an optimal ratio of frames for prediction at inference, where we could further reduce the inference latency by 57.15%.

To illuminate agent decisions and align them with game mechanics, we employ a novel method: visualizing Experience Replay via Deep SHAP Explainer.

Recently, data-driven predictions have attracted interest in high-stakes decision-making. Despite this, advanced AI methods are less often used for such tasks. This is because AI technology is a black box for the social systems it is meant to support; trustworthiness and fairness have not yet been established. Meanwhile in the field of marketing, strategic decision-making is a high-stakes problem that has a significant impact on business trends. For global marketing, with its diverse cultures and market environments, future decision-making is likely to focus on building consensus on the formulation of the problem itself rather than on solutions for achieving the goal. There are two important and conflicting facts: the fact that the core of domestic strategic decision-making comes down to the formulation of the problem itself, and the fact that it is difficult to realize AI technology that can achieve problem formulation. How can we resolve this difficulty with current technology? This is the main challenge for the realization of high-level human-AI systems in the marketing field. Thus, we propose customer journey mapping (CJM) automation through model-level data fusion, a process for the practical problem formulation known as explainable alignment. Using domain-specific requirements and observations as inputs, the system automatically outputs a CJM. Explainable alignment corresponds with both human and AI perspectives and in formulating the problem, thereby improving strategic decision-making in marketing. Following preprocessing to make latent variables and their dynamics transparent with latent Dirichlet allocation and a variational autoencoder, a post-hoc explanation is implemented in which a hidden Markov model and learning from an interpretation transition are combined with a long short-term memory architecture that learns sequential data between touchpoints for extracting attitude rules for CJM. Finally, we realize the application of human-AI systems to strategic decision-making in marketing with actual logs in over-the-top media services, in which the dynamic behavior of customers for CJM can be automatically extracted."

This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI’s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5× semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them."

A challenge for traditional methods in quality management is to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear manufacturing data. We address this challenge by adapting explainable artificial intelligence to the context of quality management. Specifically, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with Shapley additive explanations to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a field experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared with the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss of 21.7%. Furthermore, we report on results from a postexperimental rollout of the decision model, which also resulted in significant yield improvements. We demonstrate the operational value of explainable artificial intelligence by showing that critical drivers of process quality can go undiscovered by the use of traditional methods.

Ecological embeddedness is a subset of the circular economy (CE) that demands legitimacy through design changes to product, production and/or packaging for benefits to economic actors and the environment. This is in contrast with legitimacy as a public relations exercise. Blockchain is a digital transformation technology that is not fully conceptualized with respect to supply chain implementation and the related strategy formulation, particularly in the context of sustainability. Furthermore, the integration of consumers into the CE remains not well understood or researched, with the main focus of CE being the cycling of resources. Methods: This research employs a qualitative case study methodology of the first coffee business in the USA to use blockchain technology as an exemplar. Gap analysis is then applied to identify how blockchain could be used to advance from the current state to a more sustainable one. Results: Findings indicate that the implementation of blockchain is not ecologically embedded in the example studied. Conclusions: The extension of blockchain technology to consider the by-products of production and valorizable waste throughout the supply chain as assets would support ecologically embedded CE for coffee."

Smart contracts are scripts on the top of the blockchain technology. They represent a form of automation by what the layers of intermediaries can be reduced or even completely replaced. Accordingly, blockchain smart contracting systems decrease transaction and enforcement costs as well as process time.
Moreover, we argue, blockchain and smart contracts can facilitate cross-organisational collaboration and their underlying business processes. Hence, they are able to support the integration of entrepreneurs and SMEs into trans-national supply chains by reducing high entry barriers and weakening the dominating position of big players.
This paper discusses the research questions how blockchain smart contracting can facilitate the implementation of collaborative logistics structures and how the integration of SMEs into sustainable maritime supply chains can be safeguarded. The research bases on expert interviews and case studies. The results showcase the potentials of using blockchain smart contracting in the environment of trans-national and multimodal supply chains."

We consider an entrepreneur who uses outside financing and exerts private effort to build a platform and users who decide whether to join in response to the platform’s dynamic transaction fee policy. We first show that raising capital by issuing tokens rather than equity mitigates effort under-provision because the payoff to equity investors depends on profit, whereas the payoff to token investors depends on transaction volume, which is less sensitive to effort. Second, we show that decentralized governance associated with tokenization eliminates a potential holdup of platform users, which in turn alleviates the need to provide users with incentives to join, reducing the entrepreneur’s financing burden. The downside of tokenization is that it puts a cap on how much capital the entrepreneur can raise. Namely, if tokens are highly liquid, that is, they change hands many times per unit of time, their market capitalization is small relative to the net present value (NPV) of the platform profits, limiting how much money one can raise by issuing tokens rather than equity. If building the platform is expensive, this can distort the capacity investment. The resulting tradeoff between the benefits and costs of tokenization leads to several predictions regarding adoption.  This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management."

Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the dataset obtained from 84 companies. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that blockchain technology utilization increases transparency, flexibility, and trust in supply chains. According to these results, it is suggested that companies should invest in blockchain technology to make their supply chain more transparent, flexible, and secure. Moreover, blockchain plays a crucial role in building mutual trust with supply chain stakeholders. Finally, the research includes some considerations on the positive implications and potential of blockchain in collaboration and integration."

This cognitive model matches well with the human predictive power statistics measuring reliance decisions; we obtain from the model an internal estimate of automation reliability that mirrors human subjective ratings. The model is able to predict the effect of various potential disruptions, such as environmental changes or particular classes of adversarial intrusions on human trust in automation. Finally, we consider the use of model predictions to improve automation transparency that account for human cognitive biases in order to optimize the bidirectional interaction between human and machine through supporting trust calibration.

Across both studies, our results reveal that groups with at least one female member are significantly better calibrated than all-male groups. This effect is mediated by the extent to which group members share opinions and information during the group discussion. Moreover, we find that compared to a statistical aggregation of individual confidence intervals, group discussions have a neutral or positive effect on the quality of confidence judgments for groups with at least one female group member; in contrast, group discussion actually harms confidence calibration for all-male groups.

Hence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in order to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, which originate in our own flawed ways of thinking. This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI’s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5× semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them."

Hence, the question of how human social cognition mechanisms are activated in interactions with artificial agents, such as humanoid robots, is frequently being asked. One interesting question is whether humans perceive humanoid robots as mere artifacts (interpreting their behavior with reference to their function, thereby adopting the design stance) or as intentional agents (interpreting their behavior with reference to mental states, thereby adopting the intentional stance). Due to their humanlike appearance, humanoid robots might be capable of evoking the intentional stance. On the other hand, the knowledge that humanoid robots are only artifacts should call for adopting the design stance. Thus, observing a humanoid robot might evoke a cognitive conflict between the natural tendency of adopting the intentional stance and the knowledge about the actual nature of robots, which should elicit the design stance. In the present study, we investigated the cognitive conflict hypothesis by measuring participants’ pupil dilation during the completion of the InStance Test. Prior to each pupillary recording, participants were instructed to observe the humanoid robot iCub behaving in two different ways (either machine-like or humanlike behavior). Results showed that pupil dilation and response time patterns were predictive of individual biases in the adoption of the intentional or design stance in the IST. These results may suggest individual differences in mental effort and cognitive flexibility in reading and interpreting the behavior of an artificial agent."

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

Methods: We used a survey and studied six cases; data were collected both at the start of the pandemic and one year into the pandemic. This paper offers the first empirical exploration of the first full year of the pandemic and provides data points from both early and one year into the pandemic. Results: Our findings indicate that not only are pandemic risks far from mitigated, several types of risks have also increased in severity. Multifaceted and multidirectional approaches have been adopted, going well beyond demand and supply risks (the risks most widely considered in the literature) and much more work remains for supply chain managers to mitigate risks and improve supply chain resilience. Conclusions: We find that in addition to the risk management techniques, considering behavioral aspects is key for navigating a pathway towards risk mitigation."

Artif. Intell.,7,2024,Frontiers Media SA,,,"If humans are to team with artificial teammates, factors that influence trust and shared accountability must be considered when designing agents. This study investigates the influence of anthropomorphism, rank, decision cost, and task difficulty on trust in human-autonomous teams (HAT) and how blame is apportioned if shared tasks fail. Participants (N = 31) completed repeated trials with an artificial teammate using a low-fidelity variation of an air-traffic control game. We manipulated anthropomorphism (human-like or machine-like), military rank of artificial teammates using three-star (superiors), two-star (peers), or one-star (subordinate) agents, the perceived payload of vehicles with people or supplies onboard, and task difficulty with easy or hard missions using a within-subject design. A behavioural measure of trust was inferred when participants accepted agent recommendations, and a measure of no trust when recommendations were rejected or ignored. We analysed the data for trust using binomial logistic regression. After each trial, blame was apportioned using a 2-item scale and analysed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. A post-experiment questionnaire obtained participants’ power distance orientation using a seven-item scale. Possible power-related effects on trust and blame apportioning are discussed. Our findings suggest that artificial agents with higher levels of anthropomorphism and lower levels of rank increased trust and shared accountability, with human team members accepting more blame for team failures."

It analyzes the benefits that firms can obtain when investing in specific technologies to boost the impact of technologies and sustainable practices on CSCs, and further increase performance. Methods: We test several hypotheses by using structural equation modeling as well as multi-group analysis to verify whether CSCs can be achieved through sustainable practices and technologies and improve the firms’ performance. Results: The empirical results partially support the research hypotheses. While the main research hypotheses are fully supported, the analysis of single digital technologies reveals that only a few solutions can contribute to both the management and the improvement of the CSC. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the identification of green suppliers and ad hoc environmental regulations, combined with attention to the origin and provenance of raw materials, can promote a CSC. Moreover, transportation management systems (TMS) and the internet of things (IoT) are efficient technologies for managing transportation and product flow in the CSC. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) is effective in making positive green decisions, and 3D printing can extend product life."

In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers’ influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers’ and retailers’ decisions. When taking into account retailers’ buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer’s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

Costs, GHG emissions, and carbon tax prices differ in each country due to economic conditions, energy mixes, and government policies. Additionally, multiple countries have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices. Conclusions: We found that FTAs would not cause carbon leakage directly and would be effective for reducing GHG emissions economically."

An integrated blockchain homomorphic encryption standard with an in‐build supervised learning‐based smart contract is designed to improvise personal data prevention. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has advanced in healthcare with the rapid establishment of decentralised communication systems. Distributed ledgers have resource constraints to leverage public, private, and hybrid blockchain transactions to facilitate heterogeneous operations. The authors propose a supervised learning strategy in healthcare to mitigate learning health‐related issues, improvise clinical monitoring, and ensure secure communication. The proposed approach handles the vast IoMT data by adopting blockchain for IoMT as (BIoMT) to preserve sensitive clinical information. It incorporates hybrid encryption techniques to improve patient and health records' privacy protection. BIoMT also maintains secured and sustainable supply chain management with a highly confidential decentralised framework using blockchain‐based smart contracts, which minimises data loss. Moreover, a framework is designed with a hybrid hashing that integrates a homomorphically encrypted algorithm to support a smart contract for decentralised applicability. The BIoMT approach is tested and compared with the relevant prevention mechanisms. The evaluation shows that the effects observed from the result analysis noted that the proposed method outperforms reliable prevention mechanisms compared to the existing approaches."

This project investigates how FHE with deep learning can be used at scale toward accurate sequence prediction, with a relatively low time complexity, the problems that such a system incurs, and mitigations/solutions for such problems. In addition, we discuss how this could have an impact on the future of data privacy and how it can enable data sharing across various actors in the agri-food supply chain, hence allowing the development of machine learning-based systems. Finally, we find that although FHE incurs a high spatial complexity cost, the run time is within expected reasonable bounds, while allowing for absolutely private predictions to be made, in our case for milk yield prediction with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 12.4% and an accuracy of 87.6% on average."

To adapt to this dynamic environment, supply chains have become increasingly reliant on collaboration, integration, flexibility, and trust between stakeholders. Therefore, the importance of new technological applications in supply chains has grown even more. To improve supply chain flow control, modern specialized applications must be implemented. Blockchain technology has established itself as a necessary component of today’s competitive environment. Companies should invest in blockchain technology to respond quickly to changing market conditions and demands in today’s dynamic business environment. In this regard, this study investigates the effect of blockchain technology utilization on supply chain transparency, supply chain flexibility, and trust in suppliers. For this purpose, first, data were collected from the first 1000 exporting firms declared in 2019 by the Turkey Exporters Assembly using a survey method. Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the dataset obtained from 84 companies. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that blockchain technology utilization increases transparency, flexibility, and trust in supply chains. According to these results, it is suggested that companies should invest in blockchain technology to make their supply chain more transparent, flexible, and secure. Moreover, blockchain plays a crucial role in building mutual trust with supply chain stakeholders. Finally, the research includes some considerations on the positive implications and potential of blockchain in collaboration and integration."

Robot. AI,9,2022,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Emergence of responsible behavior is explored in non-cooperative games involving autonomous agents. Rather than imposing constraints or external reinforcements, agents are endowed with an elastic “sense of self” or an elastic identity that they curate based on rational considerations. This approach is called “computational transcendence (CT).” We show that agents using this model make choices for collective welfare instead of individual benefit. First, relevance of this model in game theoretic contexts like Prisoners’ dilemma and collusion is presented. Next, a generic multi-agent framework for simulating dilemmas around responsible agency is also proposed. CT implemented on this framework, is shown to be versatile in acting responsibly to different kinds of circumstances–including modifying their strategy based on their interaction with other agents in the system as well as interacting with adversaries that are rational maximizers, and who have a rationale to exploit responsible behavior from other agents. CT is also shown to outperform reciprocity as a strategy for responsible autonomy. Thus, we present CT as a framework for building autonomous agents which can intrinsically act responsibly in multi-agent systems. The core model for computational ethics presented in this paper can potentially be adapted to the needs of applications in areas like supply chains, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles. This paper hopes to motivate further research on responsible AI, by exploring computational modeling of this elusive concept called the “sense of self” that is a central element of existential inquiry in humans."

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

Ecological embeddedness is a subset of the circular economy (CE) that demands legitimacy through design changes to product, production and/or packaging for benefits to economic actors and the environment. This is in contrast with legitimacy as a public relations exercise. Blockchain is a digital transformation technology that is not fully conceptualized with respect to supply chain implementation and the related strategy formulation, particularly in the context of sustainability. Furthermore, the integration of consumers into the CE remains not well understood or researched, with the main focus of CE being the cycling of resources. Methods: This research employs a qualitative case study methodology of the first coffee business in the USA to use blockchain technology as an exemplar. Gap analysis is then applied to identify how blockchain could be used to advance from the current state to a more sustainable one. Results: Findings indicate that the implementation of blockchain is not ecologically embedded in the example studied. Conclusions: The extension of blockchain technology to consider the by-products of production and valorizable waste throughout the supply chain as assets would support ecologically embedded CE for coffee."

For the past 20 years, the concept of green manufacturing has grown from infancy to a fully formed framework agreed upon by world-leading enterprises. With the unprecedented development of the information technology today, the industrial data collected could assist in the in-depth study on green manufacturing, which ranges from the operations of machining tools all the way to supply chain management. The wide scope of research promises a tremendous amount of annual publications in this field. To better facilitate follow-up research work, the present study provides a systematic overview of green manufacturing-related areas, including research progress and the developed features. The article set retrieved from the Web of Science contains 5989 documents related to green manufacturing. It is revealed that Journal of Cleaner Production is the most productive journal, archiving documents within the scope of green manufacturing. P. R. China tops the list of the number of documents with 1357 documents (22.66%), while Zhejiang University is the most productive institution. As the cooperation network indicates, P. R. China and the United States maintain the strongest collaborative links with other countries/regions. Finally, possible future directions are recommended based on the findings in the study. For instance, additive manufacturing technology and industrial IoT both have a great potential in green manufacturing; the weak link between the disciplines of manufacturing engineering and environmental science is expected to be strengthened, and a stronger international cooperation is believed to be beneficial to the field for the otherwise isolated countries/regions.

Methods: We test several hypotheses by using structural equation modeling as well as multi-group analysis to verify whether CSCs can be achieved through sustainable practices and technologies and improve the firms’ performance. Results: The empirical results partially support the research hypotheses. While the main research hypotheses are fully supported, the analysis of single digital technologies reveals that only a few solutions can contribute to both the management and the improvement of the CSC. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the identification of green suppliers and ad hoc environmental regulations, combined with attention to the origin and provenance of raw materials, can promote a CSC. Moreover, transportation management systems (TMS) and the internet of things (IoT) are efficient technologies for managing transportation and product flow in the CSC.

The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives’ trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their “network trust”) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives’ professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives’ trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain.

Social preferences refer to intrinsic concerns for the other party's welfare, reciprocating a history of a positive relationship, and intrinsic desires for a higher relative payoff compared with the other party's when status is salient. This article provides experimental evidence that social preferences systematically affect economic decision making in supply chain transactions. Specifically, supply chain parties deviate from the predictions provided by self-interested profit-maximization models, such that relationship preference promotes cooperation, individual performance, and high system efficiency, sustainable over time; whereas status preference induces tough actions and reduces both system efficiency and individual performance.social preference, relationship, status, supply chain performance, experimental economics"

Costs, GHG emissions, and carbon tax prices differ in each country due to economic conditions, energy mixes, and government policies. Additionally, multiple countries have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices. Conclusions: We found that FTAs would not cause carbon leakage directly and would be effective for reducing GHG emissions economically."

Background: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a critical role in every economy, and limited studies have highlighted the significance of resilience in the firms. Therefore, this study aims to determine the impact of supply chain resilience on SMEs’ performance in Saudi Arabia based on three dimensions of resilience, namely agility, robustness, and flexibility. It aims to investigate how they relate to the dimensions of SMEs’ performance, namely production performance and market/sales performance. This study also investigates the overall impact of supply chain resilience as a construct on SMEs’ performance. Methods: This study employed a quantitative research design to answer the research questions. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The study was based on 255 samples of managers in SMEs from Saudi Arabia. The hypothesized model has been tested using the SPSS/Amos 26. Results: Based on the findings, it has been found that supply chain agility and flexibility had a significant positive relationship with SMEs’ production and marketing/sales performances. Supply chain robustness demonstrated a significant positive relationship with SMEs’ production performance but not their marketing/sales performances. Overall, there was a significant positive relationship between supply chain resilience and SMEs’ performance. Conclusions: This study contributes to the body of literature on supply chain resilience by expounding knowledge on aspects such as agility, flexibility, and robustness.

We consider a model of two supply chains each consisting of one manufacturer selling to one retailer, with the retailers engaging in Cournot or Bertrand competition. For Cournot retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either competition is less intense or at least one retailer's information is less accurate. A supply chain may become worse off when making its information more accurate or production diseconomy smaller, if such an improvement induces the firms in the rival supply chain to cease sharing information. For Bertrand retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either competition is less intense or information is more accurate. Under Bertrand competition a manufacturer may be worse off by receiving information, which is never the case under Cournot competition.

As supply chain managers are responding to these risks, several theories may inform those efforts. In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed."

Accordingly, recent studies in the literature have emphasized the significance of environmentally concerned logistics operations (ECLO). Research in the broad area of ECLO encompasses a wide range of topics including sustainable supply chain, green supply chain, closed-loop supply chain, low-carbon logistics, and waste management. In this paper, a comprehensive content analysis and area review is presented. Over 800 papers published between 1994 and 2017 in peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters are utilized. These papers are analyzed in consecutive stages after being reviewed under a structural dimension process that addresses the fields of environmentally concerned logistics operations. Following the state-of-the-art review, a detailed analysis of ECLO research with a special emphasis on fuzzy applications is provided. The findings clearly indicate that the fuzzy multi-criteria decision making technique is a frequently used hybrid method, whereas fuzzy sets theory and other fuzzy hybrid techniques identify a gap in the related literature. This paper provides further critical analysis and other research suggestions in order to clarify these gaps and offer additional research perspectives. This information may provide extensive data that will enable future researchers to fill these gaps within this field."

This study was carried out to address the effects of procurement sustainability on reverse logistics. It considered four objectives: to establish the relationship between environmental procurement sustainability and reverse logistics, to examine the relationship between economic procurement sustainability and reverse logistics, to examine the relationship between social sustainability procurement and reverse logistics, and to examine the moderating role of government policy. Methods: This study applied structural equation modeling to check the research hypotheses. A purposive sampling technique was used. A structured questionnaire was used to gather primary data. The data gathered were analyzed using descriptive and inferential analysis. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 21. The study found that environmental, economic, and social procurement sustainability has a significant and positive effect on reverse logistics. Government policy moderates the relationships between environmental, economic, and social procurement sustainability and reverse logistics. Conclusions: This study recommends that organizations team up with environmental protection agencies to produce environmentally friendly products. Social interventions that can help protect society from damage should be acknowledged. Good economic policies that ensure that organizations increase their wealth should also be acknowledged."
2023-11-01,Optimizing Voyage Costs in Maritime Supply Chains: A Holistic Approach Towards Logistics Service Improvement and Supply Chain Finance,10.2478/ttj-2023-0028,"[{'author_name': 'Gunnar Prause', 'author_slug': 'Gunnar Prause', 'author_sequence_number': None, 'affiliation': None, 'affiliation_slug': None}]",Transport and Telecommunication Journal,,24,2023,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,4,361-374,"Abstract
               The multi-objective optimization for voyage planning, which aims to balance time, fuel utilization, and all other relevant service costs, is noticeably absent in the scientific literature. The reason behind this gap is closely linked to the involvement of a large number of participants with conflicting interests in the process. This complexity explains why modelling an optimization tool for maritime logistics services appears challenging. Although new technologies such as blockchains and smart contracts have helped reduce the number of participants and address some complexities, they cannot fully resolve the fragmentation observed in maritime transport.
               To address the need for optimized voyage management for vessels, this study takes a holistic approach to voyage costs within the maritime supply chain, similar to how a single company would approach it. The study combines a case study from the container shipping industry, expert interviews, project results, and secondary empirical data research to develop a financial model for optimizing voyage costs. The research opens up opportunities for improving logistics services and developing new business models in the field of supply chain finance."

Robot. AI,9,2022,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Emergence of responsible behavior is explored in non-cooperative games involving autonomous agents. Rather than imposing constraints or external reinforcements, agents are endowed with an elastic “sense of self” or an elastic identity that they curate based on rational considerations. This approach is called “computational transcendence (CT).” We show that agents using this model make choices for collective welfare instead of individual benefit. First, relevance of this model in game theoretic contexts like Prisoners’ dilemma and collusion is presented. Next, a generic multi-agent framework for simulating dilemmas around responsible agency is also proposed. CT implemented on this framework, is shown to be versatile in acting responsibly to different kinds of circumstances–including modifying their strategy based on their interaction with other agents in the system as well as interacting with adversaries that are rational maximizers, and who have a rationale to exploit responsible behavior from other agents. CT is also shown to outperform reciprocity as a strategy for responsible autonomy. Thus, we present CT as a framework for building autonomous agents which can intrinsically act responsibly in multi-agent systems. The core model for computational ethics presented in this paper can potentially be adapted to the needs of applications in areas like supply chains, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles. This paper hopes to motivate further research on responsible AI, by exploring computational modeling of this elusive concept called the “sense of self” that is a central element of existential inquiry in humans."

The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives’ trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their “network trust”) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives’ professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives’ trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives’ knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes.
