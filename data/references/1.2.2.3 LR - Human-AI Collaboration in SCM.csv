2023-09-29,Defining human-AI teaming the human-centered way: a scoping review and network analysis,10.3389/frai.2023.1250725,"[{'author_name': 'Sophie Berretta', 'author_slug': 'Sophie Berretta', 'author_sequence_number': None, 'affiliation': None, 'affiliation_slug': None}]",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,Front. Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"IntroductionWith the advancement of technology and the increasing utilization of AI, the nature of human work is evolving, requiring individuals to collaborate not only with other humans but also with AI technologies to accomplish complex goals. This requires a shift in perspective from technology-driven questions to a human-centered research and design agenda putting people and evolving teams in the center of attention. A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.MethodsThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view. In addition, antecedents and outcomes examined in the literature are extracted to guide future research in this field.ResultsThrough network analysis, five clusters with different research focuses on HAIT were identified. These clusters revolve around (1) human and (2) task-dependent variables, (3) AI explainability, (4) AI-driven robotic systems, and (5) the effects of AI performance on human perception. Despite these diverse research focuses, the current body of literature is predominantly driven by a technology-centric and engineering perspective, with no consistent definition or terminology of HAIT emerging to date.DiscussionWe propose a unifying definition combining a human-centered and team-oriented perspective as well as summarize what is still needed in future research regarding HAIT. Thus, this work contributes to support the idea of the Frontiers Research Topic of a theoretical and conceptual basis for human work with AI systems."
2023-11-01,Configurations of human-centered AI at work: seven actor-structure engagements in organizations,10.3389/frai.2023.1272159,"[{'author_name': 'Uta Wilkens', 'author_slug': 'Uta Wilkens', 'author_sequence_number': None, 'affiliation': None, 'affiliation_slug': None}]",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,Front. Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"PurposeThe discourse on the human-centricity of AI at work needs contextualization. The aim of this study is to distinguish prevalent criteria of human-centricity for AI applications in the scientific discourse and to relate them to the work contexts for which they are specifically intended. This leads to configurations of actor-structure engagements that foster human-centricity in the workplace.Theoretical foundationThe study applies configurational theory to sociotechnical systems’ analysis of work settings. The assumption is that different approaches to promote human-centricity coexist, depending on the stakeholders responsible for their application.MethodThe exploration of criteria indicating human-centricity and their synthesis into configurations is based on a cross-disciplinary literature review following a systematic search strategy and a deductive-inductive qualitative content analysis of 101 research articles.ResultsThe article outlines eight criteria of human-centricity, two of which face challenges of human-centered technology development (trustworthiness and explainability), three challenges of human-centered employee development (prevention of job loss, health, and human agency and augmentation), and three challenges of human-centered organizational development (compensation of systems’ weaknesses, integration of user-domain knowledge, accountability, and safety culture). The configurational theory allows contextualization of these criteria from a higher-order perspective and leads to seven configurations of actor-structure engagements in terms of engagement for (1) data and technostructure, (2) operational process optimization, (3) operators’ employment, (4) employees’ wellbeing, (5) proficiency, (6) accountability, and (7) interactive cross-domain design. Each has one criterion of human-centricity in the foreground. Trustworthiness does not build its own configuration but is proposed to be a necessary condition in all seven configurations.DiscussionThe article contextualizes the overall debate on human-centricity and allows us to specify stakeholder-related engagements and how these complement each other. This is of high value for practitioners bringing human-centricity to the workplace and allows them to compare which criteria are considered in transnational declarations, international norms and standards, or company guidelines."

Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and created an unprecedented emergency in healthcare and other related frontline sectors. Various Artificial-Intelligence-based models were developed to effectively manage medical resources and identify patients at high risk. However, many of these AI models were limited in their practical high-risk applicability due to their “black-box” nature, i.e., lack of interpretability of the model. To tackle this problem, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was introduced, aiming to explore the “black box” behavior of machine learning models and offer definitive and interpretable evidence. XAI provides interpretable analysis in a human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence in the successful implementation of AI systems in the wild.MethodsIn this regard, this study explores the use of model-agnostic XAI models, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), for COVID-19 symptom analysis in Indian patients toward a COVID severity prediction task. Various machine learning models such as Decision Tree Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Neural Network Classifier are leveraged to develop Machine Learning models.Results and discussionThe proposed XAI tools are found to augment the high performance of AI systems with human interpretable evidence and reasoning, as shown through the interpretation of various explainability plots. Our comparative analysis illustrates the significance of XAI tools and their impact within a healthcare context. The study suggests that SHAP and LIME analysis are promising methods for incorporating explainability in model development and can lead to better and more trustworthy ML models in the future."

Results show that for applications where humans and AI have comparable capabilities, the difference in performance (between the human and AI) is a moderate indicator of change in trust; however, human or AI performance individually were weak indicators. Additionally, results indicate that biases typically seen in human-human interactions may also occur in human-AI interactions when AI transparency is low."

Various strategies and guidelines highlight the concept as a key goal. However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance. Finally, the article introduces a systemic approach to ethically and socially sustainable, human-centered AI development and deployment."

AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives. We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation.&#x0D;

This manuscript evaluates the transformative potential of LLMs for the synthesis of information, linguistic enhancements, and global knowledge dissemination. At the same time, it raises concerns about unintentional plagiarism, the risk of misinformation, data biases, and an over-reliance on AI. To address these, we propose governing principles for AI adoption that ensure integrity, transparency, validity, and accountability. Additionally, guidelines for reporting AI involvement in manuscript development are delineated, and a classification system to specify the level of AI assistance is introduced. This approach uniquely addresses the challenges of AI in scientific writing, emphasizing transparency in authorship, qualification of AI involvement, and ethical considerations. Concerns regarding access equity, potential biases in AI-generated content, authorship dynamics, and accountability are also explored, emphasizing the human author’s continued responsibility. Recommendations are made for fostering collaboration between AI developers, researchers, and journal editors and for emphasizing the importance of AI’s responsible use in academic writing. Regular evaluations of AI’s impact on the quality and biases of medical manuscripts are also advocated. As we navigate the expanding realm of AI in scientific discourse, it is crucial to maintain the human element of creativity, ethics, and oversight, ensuring that the integrity of scientific literature remains uncompromised."

The debate has often focused on the potential of AI for human task automation, omitting the strategic incentive for firms to cooperate with their workers as to exploit AI technologies for the most relevant benefit of new product and service innovation.MethodWe calibrate an empirical probit regression model of how changes in employment relate to AI diffusion, based on formalizing a game-theoretical model of a firm exploiting the twin role of AI innovation and AI automation for both absolute and competitive advantage.ResultsThe theoretical game-theory prediction is that employment following AI technology adoption is not negative, and ultimately depends on how AI leads to new success in innovation, competition which defines the competitive reward of innovation and profit sharing between workers and firms. Our estimation, is based on a global survey of 3,000 large companies across 10 countries, demonstrates that a firm employment growth depends on two strategic postures, that is, the firm relative maturity of AI adoption as well as its relative bias toward AI-based product innovation.DiscussionThe contribution of this research is to highlight the twin role of firm and workers in shaping how technology will affect employment. AI in particular marries the potential of task automation with even more potential for expansion."

This paper looks at the possible links between AI and employment in a cross-country context. It adapts the AI occupational impact measure developed by Felten, Raj and Seamans—an indicator measuring the degree to which occupations rely on abilities in which AI has made the most progress—and extends it to 23 OECD countries. Overall, there appears to be no clear relationship between AI exposure and employment growth. However, in occupations where computer use is high, greater exposure to AI is linked to higher employment growth. The paper also finds suggestive evidence of a negative relationship between AI exposure and growth in average hours worked among occupations where computer use is low. One possible explanation is that partial automation by AI increases productivity directly as well as by shifting the task composition of occupations toward higher value-added tasks. This increase in labor productivity and output counteracts the direct displacement effect of automation through AI for workers with good digital skills, who may find it easier to use AI effectively and shift to non-automatable, higher-value added tasks within their occupations. The opposite could be true for workers with poor digital skills, who may not be able to interact efficiently with AI and thus reap all potential benefits of the technology1."

A field that might benefit from such an approach is artificial intelligence (AI) research, where the number of scientific publications has been growing exponentially over recent years, making it challenging for human researchers to keep track of the progress. Here we use AI techniques to predict the future research directions of AI itself. We introduce a graph-based benchmark based on real-world data—the Science4Cast benchmark, which aims to predict the future state of an evolving semantic network of AI. For that, we use more than 143,000 research papers and build up a knowledge network with more than 64,000 concept nodes. We then present ten diverse methods to tackle this task, ranging from pure statistical to pure learning methods. Surprisingly, the most powerful methods use a carefully curated set of network features, rather than an end-to-end AI approach. These results indicate a great potential that can be unleashed for purely ML approaches without human knowledge. Ultimately, better predictions of new future research directions will be a crucial component of more advanced research suggestion tools."

The goal of the present perspective article is to unpack this tension in more detail, focusing on the example of teacher dashboards. Our contribution to theory is to show that insights from the research field of teacher professional vision can help explain why stakeholder involvement may lead to tension. In particular, we discuss that the sources of information that teachers use in their professional vision, and which data sources could be included on dashboards, might differ with respect to whether they actually relate to student learning or not. Using this difference as a starting point for participatory design could help navigate the aforementioned tension. Subsequently, we describe several implications for practice and research that could help move the field of human centered design further."

We find that (1) while Grad-CAM generally localized pathologies better than the other evaluated saliency methods, all seven performed significantly worse compared with the human benchmark, (2) the gap in localization performance between Grad-CAM and the human benchmark was largest for pathologies that were smaller in size and had shapes that were more complex, and (3) model confidence was positively correlated with Grad-CAM localization performance. Our work demonstrates that several important limitations of saliency methods must be addressed before we can rely on them for deep learning explainability in medical imaging."

Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Calibrating appropriate trust of non-expert users in artificial intelligence (AI) systems is a challenging yet crucial task. To align subjective levels of trust with the objective trustworthiness of a system, users need information about its strengths and weaknesses. The specific explanations that help individuals avoid over- or under-trust may vary depending on their initial perceptions of the system. In an online study, 127 participants watched a video of a financial AI assistant with varying degrees of decision agency. They generated 358 spontaneous text descriptions of the system and completed standard questionnaires from the Trust in Automation and Technology Acceptance literature (including perceived system competence, understandability, human-likeness, uncanniness, intention of developers, intention to use, and trust). Comparisons between a high trust and a low trust user group revealed significant differences in both open-ended and closed-ended answers. While high trust users characterized the AI assistant as more useful, competent, understandable, and humanlike, low trust users highlighted the system's uncanniness and potential dangers. Manipulating the AI assistant's agency had no influence on trust or intention to use. These findings are relevant for effective communication about AI and trust calibration of users who differ in their initial levels of trust."

This requires a shift in perspective from technology-driven questions to a human-centered research and design agenda putting people and evolving teams in the center of attention. A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.MethodsThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view. In addition, antecedents and outcomes examined in the literature are extracted to guide future research in this field.ResultsThrough network analysis, five clusters with different research focuses on HAIT were identified. These clusters revolve around (1) human and (2) task-dependent variables, (3) AI explainability, (4) AI-driven robotic systems, and (5) the effects of AI performance on human perception. Despite these diverse research focuses, the current body of literature is predominantly driven by a technology-centric and engineering perspective, with no consistent definition or terminology of HAIT emerging to date.DiscussionWe propose a unifying definition combining a human-centered and team-oriented perspective as well as summarize what is still needed in future research regarding HAIT. Thus, this work contributes to support the idea of the Frontiers Research Topic of a theoretical and conceptual basis for human work with AI systems."

This is especially true for patients that need support to stay as independent as possible. To be human-aware, an AI should be able to anticipate the intentions of the individual humans it interacts with, in order to understand the difficulties and limitations they are facing and to adapt accordingly. While data-driven AI approaches have recently gained a lot of attention, more research is needed on assistive AI systems that can develop models of their partners' goals to offer proactive support without needing a lot of training trials for new problems. We propose an integrated AI system that can anticipate actions of individual humans to contribute to the foundations of trustworthy human-robot interaction. We test this in Tangram, which is an exemplary sequential problem solving task that requires dynamic decision making. In this task the sequences of steps to the goal might be variable and not known by the system. These are aspects that are also recognized as real world challenges for robotic systems. A hybrid approach based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R is presented that is not purely data-driven but includes cognitive principles, meaning heuristics that guide human decisions. Core of this Cognitive Tangram Solver (CTS) framework is an ACT-R cognitive model that simulates human problem solving behavior in action, recognizes possible dead ends and identifies ways forward. Based on this model, the CTS anticipates and adapts its predictions about the next action to take in any given situation. We executed an empirical study and collected data from 40 participants. The predictions made by CTS were evaluated with the participants' behavior, including comparative statistics as well as prediction accuracy. The model's anticipations compared to the human test data provide support for justifying further steps built upon our conceptual approach."

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

This AI-supported offloading of cognitive processes also saves individuals' internal cognitive resources by distributing the task demands into their environment. In this article, we provide (1) an overview of empirical findings on cognitive offloading and (2) an outlook on how individuals' offloading behavior might change in an AI-enhanced future. More specifically, we first discuss determinants of offloading such as the design of technical tools and links to metacognition. Furthermore, we discuss benefits and risks of cognitive offloading. While offloading improves immediate task performance, it might also be a threat for users' cognitive abilities. Following this, we provide a perspective on whether individuals will make heavier use of AI-technologies for offloading in the future and how this might affect their cognition. On one hand, individuals might heavily rely on easily accessible AI-technologies which in return might diminish their internal cognition/learning. On the other hand, individuals might aim at enhancing their cognition so that they can keep up with AI-technologies and will not be replaced by them. Finally, we present own data and findings from the literature on the assumption that individuals' personality is a predictor of trust in AI. Trust in modern AI-technologies might be a strong determinant for wider appropriation and dependence on these technologies to distribute cognition and should thus be considered in an AI-enhanced future."

Artif. Intell.,4,2021,Frontiers Media SA,,,"The human-agent team, which is a problem in which humans and autonomous agents collaborate to achieve one task, is typical in human-AI collaboration. For effective collaboration, humans want to have an effective plan, but in realistic situations, they might have difficulty calculating the best plan due to cognitive limitations. In this case, guidance from an agent that has many computational resources may be useful. However, if an agent guides the human behavior explicitly, the human may feel that they have lost autonomy and are being controlled by the agent. We therefore investigated implicit guidance offered by means of an agent’s behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent acts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a collaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan. Since the human improves their plan voluntarily, he or she maintains autonomy. We modeled a collaborative agent with implicit guidance by integrating the Bayesian Theory of Mind into existing collaborative-planning algorithms and demonstrated through a behavioral experiment that implicit guidance is effective for enabling humans to maintain a balance between improving their plans and retaining autonomy."

Still, recent circumstances shed a new light on how to facilitate Design Thinking activities in a remote rather than an analog way. Due to Design Thinking's high production of artifacts and its focus on communication and interaction between team members, the theory of Distributed Cognition, specifically the Distributed Cognition for Teamwork (DiCoT) framework, provides an interesting perspective on the recent going-remote of Design Thinking activities. For this, we first highlight differences of analog vs. remote Design Thinking by analyzing corresponding literature from the recent years. Next, we apply the DiCoT framework to those findings, pointing out implications for practical facilitation of Design Thinking activities in an analog and remote setting.

This is especially true for patients that need support to stay as independent as possible. To be human-aware, an AI should be able to anticipate the intentions of the individual humans it interacts with, in order to understand the difficulties and limitations they are facing and to adapt accordingly. While data-driven AI approaches have recently gained a lot of attention, more research is needed on assistive AI systems that can develop models of their partners' goals to offer proactive support without needing a lot of training trials for new problems. We propose an integrated AI system that can anticipate actions of individual humans to contribute to the foundations of trustworthy human-robot interaction. We test this in Tangram, which is an exemplary sequential problem solving task that requires dynamic decision making. In this task the sequences of steps to the goal might be variable and not known by the system. These are aspects that are also recognized as real world challenges for robotic systems. A hybrid approach based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R is presented that is not purely data-driven but includes cognitive principles, meaning heuristics that guide human decisions. Core of this Cognitive Tangram Solver (CTS) framework is an ACT-R cognitive model that simulates human problem solving behavior in action, recognizes possible dead ends and identifies ways forward. Based on this model, the CTS anticipates and adapts its predictions about the next action to take in any given situation. We executed an empirical study and collected data from 40 participants. The predictions made by CTS were evaluated with the participants' behavior, including comparative statistics as well as prediction accuracy. The model's anticipations compared to the human test data provide support for justifying further steps built upon our conceptual approach."

This requires a shift in perspective from technology-driven questions to a human-centered research and design agenda putting people and evolving teams in the center of attention. A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.MethodsThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view. In addition, antecedents and outcomes examined in the literature are extracted to guide future research in this field.ResultsThrough network analysis, five clusters with different research focuses on HAIT were identified. These clusters revolve around (1) human and (2) task-dependent variables, (3) AI explainability, (4) AI-driven robotic systems, and (5) the effects of AI performance on human perception. Despite these diverse research focuses, the current body of literature is predominantly driven by a technology-centric and engineering perspective, with no consistent definition or terminology of HAIT emerging to date.DiscussionWe propose a unifying definition combining a human-centered and team-oriented perspective as well as summarize what is still needed in future research regarding HAIT. Thus, this work contributes to support the idea of the Frontiers Research Topic of a theoretical and conceptual basis for human work with AI systems."

To align subjective levels of trust with the objective trustworthiness of a system, users need information about its strengths and weaknesses. The specific explanations that help individuals avoid over- or under-trust may vary depending on their initial perceptions of the system. In an online study, 127 participants watched a video of a financial AI assistant with varying degrees of decision agency. They generated 358 spontaneous text descriptions of the system and completed standard questionnaires from the Trust in Automation and Technology Acceptance literature (including perceived system competence, understandability, human-likeness, uncanniness, intention of developers, intention to use, and trust). Comparisons between a high trust and a low trust user group revealed significant differences in both open-ended and closed-ended answers. While high trust users characterized the AI assistant as more useful, competent, understandable, and humanlike, low trust users highlighted the system's uncanniness and potential dangers. Manipulating the AI assistant's agency had no influence on trust or intention to use. These findings are relevant for effective communication about AI and trust calibration of users who differ in their initial levels of trust."

The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

Delays in the supply chain can bring consequences such as the lack of food products by retailers, transporters and manufacturers. Thus, this study aims to examine the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in small- and medium-sized food companies in the central region of Portugal, identifying potential problems and pointing out the respective solutions. For this purpose, the study uses a qualitative methodology through semi-structured interviews. It was found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have a codified supply chain and that generally, these companies have a minimal budget, which requires a constant search for new suppliers that represent a reduction in costs. Moreover, most of the companies surveyed faced unexpected challenges, such as a lack of alternative suppliers. The present paper is original because it studies the supply chain in SMEs in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it allows the ascertainment of practical suggestions for these companies to improve, as well as contributing to the clarification of the literature on the supply chain in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."

Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and/or valuation of derivatives. The same type of model is also successful in areas unrelated to risk management, such as sales optimization, customer lifetime value considerations, robo-advisory, and other fields of applications. The paper refers to recent related publications from central banks, financial supervisors and regulators as well as other relevant sources and working groups. It aims to give practical advice for establishing a risk-based governance and testing framework for the mentioned model types and discusses the use of recent technologies, approaches, and platforms to support the establishment of responsible, trustworthy, explainable, auditable, and manageable AI/ML in production. In view of the recent EU publication on AI, also referred to as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), we also see a certain added value for this paper as an instigator of further thinking outside of the financial services sector, in particular where “High Risk” models according to the mentioned EU consultation are concerned."

In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed."

The ubiquity of AI applications in everyday life, affecting both citizens and professionals, has made AI a common topic of discussion. However, as is evident from the documents analyzed here, concerns have been raised about the possible negative social consequences of AI, in particular discriminatory bias, making it a particularly relevant issue if people-centred, rights-based AI is to be implemented. This article aims to examine the challenges of defining, identifying and mitigating discriminatory bias in AI systems from two perspectives: (1) to conduct an ethical and normative review of European Commission documents from the last 8 years (from GDPR to AI Act regulation); and (2) to expose recommendations for key stakeholders, including designers, end-users and public authorities, to minimize/mitigate this risk. The document review was carried out on 21 EU regulatory and ethical guidelines in the field of AI, from which 152 measures were extracted, differentiated between design, governance and organizational measures. It has also been observed that there is no clear conceptual framework on the issue at the European level, showing a clear problem in providing definitions of algorithmic bias and discrimination, but not in assessing their potential negative impact on individuals. Secondly, these gaps may affect the concreteness and detail of the possible mitigation/minimization measures proposed and, subsequently, their application in different contexts. Finally, the last section of this paper presents a brief discussion and conclusions on possible issues related to the implementation of the measures extracted and certain limitations of the study."

Global expansions and knowledge transfer in supply chain networks bring efficiency and effectiveness to companies. However, the probability of supply chain complexity has also been seen increasing. The barriers to sustainable supply chain networks need to be tackled in an effective manner as they impact business operations. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate and reduce the supply chain complexities, as it will facilitate the process of knowledge transfer and increase the implementation of sustainable practises in supply chain networks. In the previous research, four supply chain complexity drivers were identified. Previous research identified four supply chain complexity drivers by conducting a systematic review. This study investigates which of the four complexity drivers impacts knowledge transfer in the context of the food supply chain sector. Methods: In this research, knowledge transfer is therefore examined from the perspective of sustainable food supply chains. Thirty exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted in this study and analysed using Nvivo (v12) software. This study utilised thematic analysis techniques for the evaluation of the interviews to gather results. Results: The results illustrated six main factors classified under broad categories: integration of Knowledge Transfer, incorporation of technological advancements in supply chain networks, supply chain complexity solutions, supply chain complexity drivers, sustainable supply chain networks, and capability to reduce supply chain complexity. The findings of this study highlight that process complexity significantly influences the process of knowledge transfer in food supply chain networks. The research findings contribute to both academic and practical domains. This study contributes to the aggregation of supply chain complexity and its impact on Knowledge Transfer. Additionally, the findings support supply chain networks, which strive to achieve efficient Knowledge Transfer to attain sustainable value in business operations. Conclusion: This study has proven that robust knowledge transfer reduces supply chain complexity as it makes supply chain systems more resilient and well-coordinated in many potential ways."

We identify three levels at which insights from human cognition can be—and have been—integrated in user models. Such integration can be very loose with user models only being inspired by general knowledge of human cognition or very tight with user models implementing specific cognitive processes. Using AI-based applications in the context of education as a case study, we demonstrate that user models that are more deeply rooted in models of cognition offer more valid and more fine-grained adaptations to an individual user. We propose that such user models can also advance the development of explainable AI."

In vivo gastral images obtained by a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) were the subject of visual explanations, with the goal of increasing health professionals’ trust in black-box predictions. We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that, with future improvements in implementation, can be generalized to different medical data sets and can provide effective decision support to medical experts."

Yet, there is no common taxonomy neither within one field (such as data science) nor between different fields (law and data science). In certain areas like healthcare, the requirements of transparency are crucial since the decisions directly affect people's lives.

Based on the analysis of the European Union (EU) legislation and literature in computer science, we submit that transparency shall be considered the “way of thinking” and umbrella concept characterizing the process of AI's development and use. Transparency shall be achieved through a set of measures such as interpretability and explainability, communication, auditability, traceability, information provision, record-keeping, data governance and management, and documentation. This approach to deal with transparency is of general nature, but transparency measures shall be always contextualized. By analyzing transparency in the healthcare context, we submit that it shall be viewed as a system of accountabilities of involved subjects (AI developers, healthcare professionals, and patients) distributed at different layers (insider, internal, and external layers, respectively). The transparency-related accountabilities shall be built-in into the existing accountability picture which justifies the need to investigate the relevant legal frameworks. These frameworks correspond to different layers of the transparency system. The requirement of informed medical consent correlates to the external layer of transparency and the Medical Devices Framework is relevant to the insider and internal layers. We investigate the said frameworks to inform AI developers on what is already expected from them with regards to transparency. We also discover the gaps in the existing legislative frameworks concerning AI's transparency in healthcare and suggest the solutions to fill them in."

They generated 358 spontaneous text descriptions of the system and completed standard questionnaires from the Trust in Automation and Technology Acceptance literature (including perceived system competence, understandability, human-likeness, uncanniness, intention of developers, intention to use, and trust). Comparisons between a high trust and a low trust user group revealed significant differences in both open-ended and closed-ended answers. While high trust users characterized the AI assistant as more useful, competent, understandable, and humanlike, low trust users highlighted the system's uncanniness and potential dangers. Manipulating the AI assistant's agency had no influence on trust or intention to use. These findings are relevant for effective communication about AI and trust calibration of users who differ in their initial levels of trust."

At least half of all children worldwide experience violence every year; globally, the total number of children between the ages of 2 and 17 years who have experienced violence in any given year is one billion. Based on a review of the literature, we argue that there is substantial potential for AI (and associated machine learning and big data), and mHealth approaches to be utilized to prevent and address violence at a large scale. This potential is particularly marked in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), although whether it could translate into effective solutions at scale remains unclear. We discuss possible entry points for Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and mHealth approaches to violence prevention, linking these to the World Health Organization's seven INSPIRE strategies. However, such work should be approached with caution. We highlight clear directions for future work in technology-based and technology-enabled violence prevention. We argue that there is a need for good agent-based models at the level of entire cities where and when violence can occur, where local response systems are. Yet, there is a need to develop common, reliable, and valid population-and individual/family-level data on predictors of violence. These indicators could be integrated into routine health or other information systems and become the basis of Al algorithms for violence prevention and response systems. Further, data on individual help-seeking behavior, risk factors for child maltreatment, and other information which could help us to identify the parameters required to understand what happens to cause, and in response to violence, are needed. To respond to ethical issues engendered by these kinds of interventions, there must be concerted, meaningful efforts to develop participatory and user-led work in the AI space, to ensure that the privacy and profiling concerns outlined above are addressed explicitly going forward. Finally, we make the case that developing AI and other technological infrastructure will require substantial investment, particularly in LMIC."

Modern technologies for cognitive support are rapidly developing and increasingly popular. Today, many individuals heavily rely on their smartphones or other technical gadgets to support their daily life but also their learning and work. For instance, smartphones are used to track and analyze changes in the environment, and to store and continually update relevant information. Thus, individuals can offload (i.e., externalize) information to their smartphones and refresh their knowledge by accessing it. This implies that using modern technologies such as AI empowers users via offloading and enables them to function as always-updated knowledge professionals, so that they can deploy their insights strategically instead of relying on outdated and memorized facts. This AI-supported offloading of cognitive processes also saves individuals' internal cognitive resources by distributing the task demands into their environment. In this article, we provide (1) an overview of empirical findings on cognitive offloading and (2) an outlook on how individuals' offloading behavior might change in an AI-enhanced future. More specifically, we first discuss determinants of offloading such as the design of technical tools and links to metacognition. Furthermore, we discuss benefits and risks of cognitive offloading. While offloading improves immediate task performance, it might also be a threat for users' cognitive abilities. Following this, we provide a perspective on whether individuals will make heavier use of AI-technologies for offloading in the future and how this might affect their cognition. On one hand, individuals might heavily rely on easily accessible AI-technologies which in return might diminish their internal cognition/learning. On the other hand, individuals might aim at enhancing their cognition so that they can keep up with AI-technologies and will not be replaced by them. Finally, we present own data and findings from the literature on the assumption that individuals' personality is a predictor of trust in AI. Trust in modern AI-technologies might be a strong determinant for wider appropriation and dependence on these technologies to distribute cognition and should thus be considered in an AI-enhanced future."

Various strategies and guidelines highlight the concept as a key goal. However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance. Finally, the article introduces a systemic approach to ethically and socially sustainable, human-centered AI development and deployment."

For effective collaboration, humans want to have an effective plan, but in realistic situations, they might have difficulty calculating the best plan due to cognitive limitations. In this case, guidance from an agent that has many computational resources may be useful. However, if an agent guides the human behavior explicitly, the human may feel that they have lost autonomy and are being controlled by the agent. We therefore investigated implicit guidance offered by means of an agent’s behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent acts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a collaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan. Since the human improves their plan voluntarily, he or she maintains autonomy. We modeled a collaborative agent with implicit guidance by integrating the Bayesian Theory of Mind into existing collaborative-planning algorithms and demonstrated through a behavioral experiment that implicit guidance is effective for enabling humans to maintain a balance between improving their plans and retaining autonomy."

To systematically address risks to autonomy, we need to confront the complexity of the concept itself and adapt governance solutions accordingly.It is hard to overstate the important role autonomy plays for our moral and political institutions. A cornerstone of human dignity and a prerequisite of liberal democracy, autonomy is often considered a fundamental human value [1-4]. Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) development opens up new opportunities for supporting and fostering autonomy, but it simultaneously poses significant risks. Recent incidents of AI-facilitated deception, manipulation, or coercion suggest that AI technologies could seriously interfere with human autonomy on a large scale. Cambridge Analytica's attempt to manipulate voters is just one example [5]. Facebook's ""emotional contagion"" experiment, in which users were swayed towards adopting certain emotional states, yet another one [6]. Consequently, human autonomy has become a central theme across guidelines and principles on the responsible development of AI. The European Commission's High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) lists 'respect for autonomy' as the first of its four key ethical principles in their Guidelines on Trustworthy AI [7]. Several other policy documents, including the Association for Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics [8], The Montreal Declaration for Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence [9], and the European Commission's White Paper on Artificial Intelligence [10], equally emphasise the need to protect and respect autonomy whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) lists autonomy as one of their human-centered values [11]. Despite this frequent call for the protection of autonomy, there remains substantial ambiguity within these documents as to (a) what exactly is meant by the term 'autonomy', as well"

Acoustic features were aggregated across each trial and normalized within each subject. Cognitive load was dichotomized for each trial by categorizing trials at &amp;gt;0.6 of each participants' maximum span as “high load.” Data were divided into training (60%), test (20%), and validate (20%) datasets, each containing different participants. Training and test data were used in model building and hyper-parameter tuning. Five classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were trained to predict cognitive load (“high” vs. “low”) based on acoustic features. Analyses were limited to correct responses. The model was evaluated using the validation dataset, across all span lengths and within the subset of trials with a four-digit span. Classifier discriminant power was examined with Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis.ResultsParticipants reached a mean span of 6.34 out of 8 items (SD = 1.38).

For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT’s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs’ exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system."

This framework maps 59 generic tasks from worker surveys and an occupational database to 14 cognitive abilities (that we extract from the cognitive science literature) and these to a comprehensive list of 328 AI benchmarks used to evaluate research intensity across a broad range of different AI areas. The use of cognitive abilities as an intermediate layer, instead of mapping work tasks to AI benchmarks directly, allows for an identification of potential AI exposure for tasks for which AI applications have not been explicitly created. An application of our framework to occupational databases gives insights into the abilities through which AI is most likely to affect jobs and allows for a ranking of occupations with respect to AI exposure. Moreover, we show that some jobs that were not known to be affected by previous waves of automation may now be subject to higher AI exposure. Finally, we find that some of the abilities where AI research is currently very intense are linked to tasks with comparatively limited labour input in the labour markets of advanced economies (e.g., visual and auditory processing using deep learning, and sensorimotor interaction through (deep) reinforcement learning).&#x0D;

AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives. We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation.&#x0D;

This study attempts to synthesise the existing literature in this research area and summarise the findings regarding barriers, drivers, and social implications of using AI in SCM. Methods: The methodology used for this meta-study is based on Kitchenham and Charters guidelines, resulting in a selection of 44 literature reviews published between 2000 and 2021. Results: As a summary of the results, the main areas of AI in SCM were algorithms, followed by the Internet of Things (IoT). The main barriers to AI adoption in SCM are change management, existing technical limitations, and the acceptance of humans for these techniques. The main drivers of AI in SCM are saving costs and increasing efficiency in combination with reducing time and resources. The main social factor is human–robot collaboration. As a result, there will be a decreased amount of labour needed in the future, impacting many existing jobs, especially in low-income areas. Conclusions: Therefore, it is essential for organisations that implement new technology to start as early as possible to inform the organisation about the changes and help them successfully implement them. It is also important to mention that constant learning and improvement of the employees are critical for adopting and successfully using new AI tools. Before investing in new technology, a solid Return on Investment calculation (ROI) and monitoring costs and value are critical to transforming the business successfully."

To align subjective levels of trust with the objective trustworthiness of a system, users need information about its strengths and weaknesses. The specific explanations that help individuals avoid over- or under-trust may vary depending on their initial perceptions of the system. In an online study, 127 participants watched a video of a financial AI assistant with varying degrees of decision agency. They generated 358 spontaneous text descriptions of the system and completed standard questionnaires from the Trust in Automation and Technology Acceptance literature (including perceived system competence, understandability, human-likeness, uncanniness, intention of developers, intention to use, and trust). Comparisons between a high trust and a low trust user group revealed significant differences in both open-ended and closed-ended answers. While high trust users characterized the AI assistant as more useful, competent, understandable, and humanlike, low trust users highlighted the system's uncanniness and potential dangers. Manipulating the AI assistant's agency had no influence on trust or intention to use. These findings are relevant for effective communication about AI and trust calibration of users who differ in their initial levels of trust."

While many robots use sensors to avoid harming humans, they cannot elaborate on human actions or intentions, making them passive reactors rather than interactive collaborators. Intention-based systems can determine human motives and predict future movements, but their closer interaction with humans raises concerns about trust. This scoping review provides an overview of sensors, algorithms, and examines the trust aspect of intention-based systems in HRI scenarios. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and IEEE Xplore databases to identify studies related to the forementioned topics of intention-based systems in HRI. Results from each study were summarized and categorized according to different intention types, representing various designs. The literature shows a range of sensors and algorithms used to identify intentions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios. However, trust of intention-based systems is not well studied. Although some research in AI and robotics can be applied to intention-based systems, their unique characteristics warrant further study to maximize collaboration performance. This review highlights the need for more research on the trust aspects of intention-based systems to better understand and optimize their role in human-robot interactions, at the same time establishes a foundation for future research in sensor and algorithm designs for intention-based systems."

Here, we argue that user models in AI can be optimized by modeling these user models more closely to models of human cognition. We identify three levels at which insights from human cognition can be—and have been—integrated in user models. Such integration can be very loose with user models only being inspired by general knowledge of human cognition or very tight with user models implementing specific cognitive processes. Using AI-based applications in the context of education as a case study, we demonstrate that user models that are more deeply rooted in models of cognition offer more valid and more fine-grained adaptations to an individual user. We propose that such user models can also advance the development of explainable AI."

We conducted an in-depth systematic review of relevant research literature and identified six key concerns related to cloud ERP implementation: a) the introduction of new ERP work arrangements, b) the migration of legacy data, c) the assurance of compliance with extant rules and regulations for security, d) the continuous alignment between ERP functionality and business processes, e) the ongoing integration between ERPs and the rest of the organization’s application portfolio, and f) the establishment of adequate reliability levels. The identified concerns are associated with both transition management and operations supported by cloud ERPs. All the identified concerns are also related to the need to achieve infrastructural embeddedness. This need sets ERPs apart from other types of cloud-based applications, such as office automation solutions that do not have as many dependencies and exchanges with other systems and repositories within an organization’s information infrastructure. We argue that the challenge of embeddedness has different implications for organizations of different sizes, and we call for further empirical research."

Traditional business process modelling (BPM) approaches are process-centric and focus on the workflow, ignoring the data modelling aspects that are essential for today’s data-centric landscape of modern businesses. Hence, a majority of BPM initiatives have failed in several organisations due to the lack of data-driven insights into their business performance. On the other hand, the information systems of today focus more on dataflows using object-oriented modelling (OOM) approaches. Even standard OOM approaches, such as unified modelling language (UML) methods, exhibit inherent weaknesses due to their lack of formalized innovation with business objects and the dynamic control-flows of complex business processes. In addition to these issues, both BPM and OOM approaches have been augmented with an array of complex software tools and techniques which have confused businesses. There is a lack of a common generalized framework that integrates the well-formalised control-flow based BPM approach and the dataflow based OOM approach that is suitable for today’s enterprise systems in order to support organisations to achieve successful business process improvements. This paper takes a modest step to fill this gap. We propose a framework using a structured six-step business process modelling (BPM) guideline combined with a business object-oriented methodology (BOOM) in a unique and practical way that could be adopted for improving an organisation’s process efficiency and business performance in contemporary enterprise systems. Our proposed business object-oriented process modelling (BOOPM) framework is applied to a business case study in order to demonstrate the practical implementation and process efficiency improvements that can be achieved in enterprise systems using such a structured and integrated approach."

The aim of this study is to distinguish prevalent criteria of human-centricity for AI applications in the scientific discourse and to relate them to the work contexts for which they are specifically intended. This leads to configurations of actor-structure engagements that foster human-centricity in the workplace.Theoretical foundationThe study applies configurational theory to sociotechnical systems’ analysis of work settings. The assumption is that different approaches to promote human-centricity coexist, depending on the stakeholders responsible for their application.MethodThe exploration of criteria indicating human-centricity and their synthesis into configurations is based on a cross-disciplinary literature review following a systematic search strategy and a deductive-inductive qualitative content analysis of 101 research articles.ResultsThe article outlines eight criteria of human-centricity, two of which face challenges of human-centered technology development (trustworthiness and explainability), three challenges of human-centered employee development (prevention of job loss, health, and human agency and augmentation), and three challenges of human-centered organizational development (compensation of systems’ weaknesses, integration of user-domain knowledge, accountability, and safety culture). The configurational theory allows contextualization of these criteria from a higher-order perspective and leads to seven configurations of actor-structure engagements in terms of engagement for (1) data and technostructure, (2) operational process optimization, (3) operators’ employment, (4) employees’ wellbeing, (5) proficiency, (6) accountability, and (7) interactive cross-domain design. Each has one criterion of human-centricity in the foreground. Trustworthiness does not build its own configuration but is proposed to be a necessary condition in all seven configurations.DiscussionThe article contextualizes the overall debate on human-centricity and allows us to specify stakeholder-related engagements and how these complement each other. This is of high value for practitioners bringing human-centricity to the workplace and allows them to compare which criteria are considered in transnational declarations, international norms and standards, or company guidelines."

We focused our attention on explaining how different approaches to intelligence (i.e., the intelligence cycle (IC) and the critical thinking process (CTP)) can be combined and linked with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) so that AI/ML is used effectively. A small group interview was undertaken with five senior security managers based in a range of companies, all of whom had extensive security knowledge and industry experience. The findings suggest that organizational learning, transformational leadership, organizational restructuring, crisis management, and corporate intelligence are fundamental components of threat intelligence and provide a basis upon which a cyber threat intelligence cycle process (CTICP) can be developed to aid the resilience building process.

Following the International Organization for Standardization, this perspective aims to ensure that the use of interactive technologies improves users' psychological load experience and behavior, e.g., in the form of reduced stress experience or increased performance. Concomitantly, this perspective attempts to proactively prevent or detect and correct the potential negative effects of these technologies on user load, such as impaired satisfaction and engagement, as early as possible. Based on this perspective, we developed and validated a questionnaire instrument, the Psychological Assessment of AI-based DSSs (PAAI), for the user-centered evaluation of the use of AI-based DSSs in practice. In particular, the instrument considers central design characteristics of AI-based DSSs and the corresponding work situation, which have a significant impact on users' psychological load.
