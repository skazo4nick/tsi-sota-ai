2021-10-07,Exploring Progress with Supply Chain Risk Management during the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic,10.3390/logistics5040070,"[{'author_name': 'Remko van Hoek', 'author_slug': 'remko-van-hoek-MVLzkk', 'author_sequence_number': '1', 'affiliation': None, 'affiliation_slug': None}]",Logistics,Logistics,5,2021,MDPI AG,4,70,"Background: In response to calls for actionable research that considers ongoing pandemic risk dynamics, we explore how risks experienced and risk mitigation techniques used have changed during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: We used a survey and studied six cases; data were collected both at the start of the pandemic and one year into the pandemic. This paper offers the first empirical exploration of the first full year of the pandemic and provides data points from both early and one year into the pandemic. Results: Our findings indicate that not only are pandemic risks far from mitigated, several types of risks have also increased in severity. Multifaceted and multidirectional approaches have been adopted, going well beyond demand and supply risks (the risks most widely considered in the literature) and much more work remains for supply chain managers to mitigate risks and improve supply chain resilience. Conclusions: We find that in addition to the risk management techniques, considering behavioral aspects is key for navigating a pathway towards risk mitigation."

Despite the potential benefits of automating the MRP tasks to meet the demand for expedited and efficient management, the field appears to be lagging behind in harnessing the advancements offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sophisticated programming languages. Consequently, this study aims to address this gap by exploring the applications of Python in simplifying the MRP processes. Methods: This article offers a twofold approach: firstly, it conducts research to uncover the potential applications of the Python code in streamlining the MRP operations, and the practical examples serve as evidence of Python’s efficacy in simplifying the MRP tasks; secondly, this article introduces a conceptual framework that showcases the Python ecosystem, highlighting libraries and structures that enable efficient data manipulation, analysis, and optimization techniques. Results: This study presents a versatile framework that integrates a variety of Python tools, including but not limited to Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, to streamline and actualize an 8-step MRP process. Additionally, it offers preliminary insights into the integration of the Python-based MRP solution (MRP.py) with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Conclusions: While the article focuses on demonstrating the practicality of Python in MRP, future endeavors will entail empirically integrating MRP.py with the ERP systems in small- and medium-sized companies. This integration will establish real-time data synchronization between the Python and ERP systems, leading to accurate MRP calculations and enhanced decision-making processes."

Furthermore, we analyzed which risks were addressed in the use cases as well as how ML might shape SCRM. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review. The results showed that the applied examples relate primarily to the early identification of production, transport, and supply risks in order to counteract potential supply chain problems quickly. Through the analyzed case studies, we were able to identify the added value that ML integration can bring to the SCRM (e.g., the integration of new data sources such as social media or weather data). From the systematic literature analysis results, we developed four propositions, which can be used as motivation for further research."

In spite of extensive research examining how IT can be employed in various activities of supply chain management, the majority of studies are limited in identifying enablers and inhibitors of adoption. Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance. In order to do so, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis on a sample of 172 European companies. We find that firms that opt for a centralized governance structure, as well as larger firms, are more likely to attain a state of procurement alignment. Furthermore, our results empirically support the statement that procurement alignment is positively correlated with operational efficiency and competitive performance of the supply chain."

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

We employ a knowledge domain visualization technique to generate insights that go beyond other review studies on blockchain research within logistics and SCM. The analysis starts with selecting a total of 628 papers from Scopus and the Web of Science that were published during 2016–2020. The bibliometric analysis output demonstrates that the number of blockchain papers has rapidly increased since 2017. The most productive researchers are from the USA, China, and India. The top academic institutions contributing to the literature are also identified. Based on network analyses, we found that the literature concentrates mainly on the conceptualization of blockchain; its potentials for supply chain sustainability; its adoption triggers and barriers; and its role in supporting supply chain agility, trust, protection of intellectual property, and food/perishable supply chains.

In this article, we propose a new computational system based on the ‘Fuzzy Extended Analytic Hierarchy Process (FEAHP)’ method for supplier selection while considering the relevant risks. We sought to evaluate the opportunities and limitations of using the FEAHP method in supplier selection and analyzed the support of the system developed through the real case of a Brazilian oil and natural gas company. The computational approach based on FEAHP automates supplier selection by determining a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. First, the criteria and sub-criteria specific to the selection problem were identified by the experts taking the relevant literature as a starting point. Next, the experts performed a pair-wise comparison of the predefined requirements using a linguistic scale. This evaluation was then quantified by calculating the priority weights of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The best decision alternative is the one with the highest final score. Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the results of the proposed model. The FEAHP computer approach automated the supplier selection process in a rational, flexible, and agile way, as perceived by the focal company. From this, we hypothesized that using this system can provide helpful insights in choosing the best suppliers in an environment of risk and uncertainty, thereby maximizing supply chain performance."

The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives’ trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their “network trust”) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives’ professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives’ trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives’ knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes.

To reduce the Sulphur emission from shipping and ensure clean shipping, a number of Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) were enforced in special areas around the globe. From 2015, in SECA, ship owners are not allowed to use fuel with more than 0.1% Sulphur content. One of the major concerns for the SECA regulation is that maritime stakeholders have had to take into consideration the costs as well as the tolerable risks of their compliance investment options. Besides that, low freight rates have increased the competition and had caused financial pressure on ship owners so that lower capital reserves and low credibility levels limit the manoeuvring space for investment activities.
The indications from BSR after 2015 showed that the low fuel price has eased the economic effects of the SECA regulation and as a result, most ship owners have delayed their investment decisions. Even though the postponement of emission abatement techniques seems to have reduced the compliance expenses for SECA, they, however, did not improve the position of shipowners relative to their competitors. Consequently, new policy instruments to stimulate innovation, to raise competitiveness and to comply with the new environmental regulations are needed. It would have been easier to hedge fuel price volatility and offer maritime logistics services for a lower price, but to be able to ensure sustainable results in long-term, maritime stakeholders must be ready to device astute strategies that can propel them to unparalleled advantage.
This research first appraised the investment risks and payback period associated with the scrubber using different capital budgeting methods. It further illustrated the Maritime Energy Contracting (MEC) model as a market mechanism for the delivery of a cost-effective emission reduction using the scrubber technology as well as an instrument to realise a competitive advantage for ship operators. The results are empirically validated by case studies from BSR."

This study aims to assess the impact of supply chain resilience in a less-developed country (Guinea-Bissau) using complex adaptive system theory. We used a qualitative methodology through multiple case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four companies. The semi-structured script contains questions about supply chain disruptions, vulnerabilities and resilience. The main results show that the companies in Guinea-Bissau, due to their dependence on the outside world and the absence of formal, larger and more diversified supply chains, suffered serious consequences with the disruption imposed by the pandemic. It was also concluded that the more resilient the supply chain, the fewer the impacts of crisis events and that the resilience of companies at this level depends on their obtaining competitive advantages over their competitors. The main practical implications of this study are the need to formalize the supply chain, diversify the supply of services and products of companies dependent on the exterior, adopt metrics that allow for the early detection of situations of supply chain disruption, effectively manage stocks and promote proactive crisis resolution strategies. Studies on the impact of resilience on supply chains in crises are scarce, especially on companies located in underdeveloped countries."

In spite of extensive research examining how IT can be employed in various activities of supply chain management, the majority of studies are limited in identifying enablers and inhibitors of adoption. Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance. In order to do so, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis on a sample of 172 European companies. We find that firms that opt for a centralized governance structure, as well as larger firms, are more likely to attain a state of procurement alignment. Furthermore, our results empirically support the statement that procurement alignment is positively correlated with operational efficiency and competitive performance of the supply chain."

In the context of the pandemic, organizations must face consequences striking the wider dimensions of sustainability. Thus, after the COVID-19 pandemic, how will the value chains collaborate for the transition from a traditional (linear) to a Circular Economy? From this question, in this paper, we analyze the international papers that connect sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with circular economy (CE). We conducted an Integrative Literature Review based on the Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2010 to 2020, using the Methodi Ordinatio protocol to classify the papers. The 37 best-ranked papers were analyzed thoroughly. The results show the prominent authors, institutions, the network relationship between authors, the evolution of publications, and the leading journals. The content of these articles was categorized and discussed about the changes in the way products are manufactured, distributed, consumed, and recovered. The integration of CE principles in SSCM has been evaluated as having potential utility for industries, cities, and businesses in general. Finally, an agenda was identified with suggestions for further research, which can aid researchers and practitioners acting in this field. Managers can obtain insights to improve supply chain sustainability and consequently respond to the challenges imposed by the current pandemic."

Maintenance and repair services, strongly associated with the reverse movement of equipment, are among the most demanding reverse supply chain operations. Equipment is scattered in various locations, and multiple suppliers are involved in its maintenance, making it challenging to manage the related reverse supply chain operations. Effective maintenance is essential for businesses-owners of the equipment, as reducing costs while improving service quality helps them gain a competitive advantage. Methods: To enhance reverse supply chain operations related to equipment maintenance, this paper presents the operational framework, the methodological approach, and the architecture for developing a system that covers the needs for predictive maintenance in the service supply chain. It is based on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as the Internet of things, machine learning, and cloud computing. Results: As a result of the successful implementation of the system, effective equipment maintenance and service supply chain management is achieved supporting the reverse supply chain. Conclusions: This will eventually lead to fewer good-conditioned spare part replacements, just in time replacements, extended equipment life cycles, and fewer unnecessary disposals."

In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers’ influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers’ and retailers’ decisions. When taking into account retailers’ buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer’s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

This study aims to assess the impact of supply chain resilience in a less-developed country (Guinea-Bissau) using complex adaptive system theory. We used a qualitative methodology through multiple case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four companies. The semi-structured script contains questions about supply chain disruptions, vulnerabilities and resilience. The main results show that the companies in Guinea-Bissau, due to their dependence on the outside world and the absence of formal, larger and more diversified supply chains, suffered serious consequences with the disruption imposed by the pandemic. It was also concluded that the more resilient the supply chain, the fewer the impacts of crisis events and that the resilience of companies at this level depends on their obtaining competitive advantages over their competitors. The main practical implications of this study are the need to formalize the supply chain, diversify the supply of services and products of companies dependent on the exterior, adopt metrics that allow for the early detection of situations of supply chain disruption, effectively manage stocks and promote proactive crisis resolution strategies. Studies on the impact of resilience on supply chains in crises are scarce, especially on companies located in underdeveloped countries."

Background: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a critical role in every economy, and limited studies have highlighted the significance of resilience in the firms. Therefore, this study aims to determine the impact of supply chain resilience on SMEs’ performance in Saudi Arabia based on three dimensions of resilience, namely agility, robustness, and flexibility. It aims to investigate how they relate to the dimensions of SMEs’ performance, namely production performance and market/sales performance. This study also investigates the overall impact of supply chain resilience as a construct on SMEs’ performance. Methods: This study employed a quantitative research design to answer the research questions. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The study was based on 255 samples of managers in SMEs from Saudi Arabia. The hypothesized model has been tested using the SPSS/Amos 26. Results: Based on the findings, it has been found that supply chain agility and flexibility had a significant positive relationship with SMEs’ production and marketing/sales performances. Supply chain robustness demonstrated a significant positive relationship with SMEs’ production performance but not their marketing/sales performances. Overall, there was a significant positive relationship between supply chain resilience and SMEs’ performance. Conclusions: This study contributes to the body of literature on supply chain resilience by expounding knowledge on aspects such as agility, flexibility, and robustness. The study enhances our understanding of the role of supply chain resilience on SMEs’ performance in an emerging economy context."

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption."

Methods: We test several hypotheses by using structural equation modeling as well as multi-group analysis to verify whether CSCs can be achieved through sustainable practices and technologies and improve the firms’ performance. Results: The empirical results partially support the research hypotheses. While the main research hypotheses are fully supported, the analysis of single digital technologies reveals that only a few solutions can contribute to both the management and the improvement of the CSC. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the identification of green suppliers and ad hoc environmental regulations, combined with attention to the origin and provenance of raw materials, can promote a CSC. Moreover, transportation management systems (TMS) and the internet of things (IoT) are efficient technologies for managing transportation and product flow in the CSC. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) is effective in making positive green decisions, and 3D printing can extend product life."

In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed."

A global supply chain network that considers disruptions is needed. This study strategically analyzes the economic and structural effects of disruption on a global supply chain network with customs duty and the trans-pacific partnership (TPP) agreement. Methods: We present a cost minimization model which helps in understanding the difficulty of supplying materials or products to factories or customers if the supplier’s cities are facing disruption. This enables us to model and evaluate simultaneous considerations of supplier disruption, customs duty, and TPP in redesigning a global supply chain network. This network is modeled and formulated using integer programming, disruption scenarios, and a sensitivity analysis for customs duty. Results: Regarding the impact of disruptions on suppliers, two patterns emerge in the reconfigured network: direct changes due to supplier disruptions and indirect changes due to factory relocation. The sensitivity analysis for customs duty shows that the TPP has a positive impact on cost maintained, even in the presence of disruptions. Conclusions: Suppliers should be switched depending on the scale of disruption; when many distant suppliers need to be switched, the factory should be relocated to the country where these suppliers are located."

These effects were felt more intensely in less-developed countries, which are highly dependent on imports of products and raw materials. This study aims to assess the impact of supply chain resilience in a less-developed country (Guinea-Bissau) using complex adaptive system theory. We used a qualitative methodology through multiple case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four companies. The semi-structured script contains questions about supply chain disruptions, vulnerabilities and resilience. The main results show that the companies in Guinea-Bissau, due to their dependence on the outside world and the absence of formal, larger and more diversified supply chains, suffered serious consequences with the disruption imposed by the pandemic. It was also concluded that the more resilient the supply chain, the fewer the impacts of crisis events and that the resilience of companies at this level depends on their obtaining competitive advantages over their competitors. The main practical implications of this study are the need to formalize the supply chain, diversify the supply of services and products of companies dependent on the exterior, adopt metrics that allow for the early detection of situations of supply chain disruption, effectively manage stocks and promote proactive crisis resolution strategies. Studies on the impact of resilience on supply chains in crises are scarce, especially on companies located in underdeveloped countries."

Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance. In order to do so, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis on a sample of 172 European companies. We find that firms that opt for a centralized governance structure, as well as larger firms, are more likely to attain a state of procurement alignment. Furthermore, our results empirically support the statement that procurement alignment is positively correlated with operational efficiency and competitive performance of the supply chain."

Costs, GHG emissions, and carbon tax prices differ in each country due to economic conditions, energy mixes, and government policies. Additionally, multiple countries have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices. Conclusions: We found that FTAs would not cause carbon leakage directly and would be effective for reducing GHG emissions economically."

Warehousing requires the classification, controlling and management of inventory as well as processing of related information. Therefore, adopting efficient and reasonable warehouse management measures to achieve effective management and control of materials is a key means to flexibly adjusting the supply and demand of storage materials and reduce operating costs. There remains a gap in the understanding of benefits and barriers to the full adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and decision support systems (DSSs) in warehouse management. Methods: This work applies a systematic literature review methodology of recent implementation case studies to analyze documented barriers and benefits of Industry 4.0 technology adoption in warehouse management. For analysis, benefits and barriers are ranked in order of importance using Pareto analysis based on their frequency of occurrence. Results: Improved process efficiency, the availability of real-time data, added competitive advantage and the ability to integrate business activities digitally are the top four most important benefits of implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and decision support systems in warehouse management. The prominent barriers to implementation are high life cycle cost, challenging physical environment/layout, inadequate supporting resource constraints, increased security risk and high energy consumption. Conclusions: Barriers to implementing Industry 4.0 technologies are interrelated in nature and prevent businesses from realizing the full benefit of implemented Industry 4.0 technologies. Adequate financial support, new knowledge and skills are required to be able to ensure the successful implementation of Industry 4.0 in warehousing management."

First, we solve the one-stop subproblem in the [Formula: see text] space and the [Formula: see text] space by leveraging the geometric structure of operations. Second, to solve a multistop problem, we embed the single-stop optimization into a tailored coordinate descent scheme, which we prove converges to a global optimum. Third, we develop a new algorithm for dial-a-ride problems based on a subpath-based time–space network optimization combining set partitioning and time–space principles. Finally, we propose an online routing algorithm to support real-world ride-sharing operations with vehicle–customer coordination. Computational results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, yielding far superior solutions in shorter computational times and can support real-time operations in very large-scale systems. From a practical standpoint, most of the benefits of vehicle–customer coordination stem from comprehensively reoptimizing “upstream” operations as opposed to merely adjusting “downstream” stopping locations.

This is especially relevant in view of growing boundarylessness of careers that impacts the logistics sector with its high ratio of lateral entrants. We enrich the analysis of training and education decision-making processes with a third view beyond the common ex ante and ex post perspectives that has not been employed yet in this context. Our insights, modeled as a new prae ante view, can help prevent myopia in educational choice on an individual level and the resulting economic inefficiencies. This translates into more fitting provisions by individuals earlier, and into improved targeting of prospective employees in logistics.

Main conclusions include that participants who were asked openly about influential factors for education and career decisions were oblivious of some factors described as highly predictive of educational and career success in literature, not acknowledging social and cultural capital, habitus, and chance, but also consistently ascribing success to a ""milestone-mindset"" to be described here as well.Logistics 2018, 2, 24 2 of 16 specific logistics education and training is beyond dispute [5][6][7], the issue of time-inconsistent choices in that regard has rarely been addressed, which appears especially striking given the high occurrence of track changes leading employees into logistics as lateral entrants [8][9][10]. Time inconsistency is a well-established topic in behavioral economics [11][12][13][14], while basic or continuing education and training are discussed in research in many contexts including our instance regarding the context of time-inconsistent educational choice in logistics.In our approach, all levels of education and training in logistics (vocational, academic, and continuing) are involved [15,16]. In this contribution, three perspectives are discerned, two of which are commonplace in economic theory. Usually, economic theory describes a decision perspective from an ex ante and ex post view. We deem this an unjustified limitation and propose an extended framework including a new ""prae ante"" view, for which this paper provides qualitative insights into the influential factors for this additional analytical perspective. Educational and career choices can be seen as investments in one's own human capital and are often analyzed both strategically (ex ante) and evaluated (ex post).

Despite the potential benefits of automating the MRP tasks to meet the demand for expedited and efficient management, the field appears to be lagging behind in harnessing the advancements offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sophisticated programming languages. Consequently, this study aims to address this gap by exploring the applications of Python in simplifying the MRP processes. Methods: This article offers a twofold approach: firstly, it conducts research to uncover the potential applications of the Python code in streamlining the MRP operations, and the practical examples serve as evidence of Python’s efficacy in simplifying the MRP tasks; secondly, this article introduces a conceptual framework that showcases the Python ecosystem, highlighting libraries and structures that enable efficient data manipulation, analysis, and optimization techniques. Results: This study presents a versatile framework that integrates a variety of Python tools, including but not limited to Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, to streamline and actualize an 8-step MRP process. Additionally, it offers preliminary insights into the integration of the Python-based MRP solution (MRP.py) with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Conclusions: While the article focuses on demonstrating the practicality of Python in MRP, future endeavors will entail empirically integrating MRP.py with the ERP systems in small- and medium-sized companies. This integration will establish real-time data synchronization between the Python and ERP systems, leading to accurate MRP calculations and enhanced decision-making processes."

We employ a knowledge domain visualization technique to generate insights that go beyond other review studies on blockchain research within logistics and SCM. The analysis starts with selecting a total of 628 papers from Scopus and the Web of Science that were published during 2016–2020. The bibliometric analysis output demonstrates that the number of blockchain papers has rapidly increased since 2017. The most productive researchers are from the USA, China, and India. The top academic institutions contributing to the literature are also identified. Based on network analyses, we found that the literature concentrates mainly on the conceptualization of blockchain; its potentials for supply chain sustainability; its adoption triggers and barriers; and its role in supporting supply chain agility, trust, protection of intellectual property, and food/perishable supply chains. Besides systematically mapping the literature, we identify several research gaps and propose numerous actionable research directions for the future. This study enriches the extant blockchain literature, provides a timely snapshot of the current state of research, and examines the knowledge structure of blockchain research in logistics and SCM with the help of evidence-based scientometric methods."

As supply chain managers are responding to these risks, several theories may inform those efforts. In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed."

This study seeks to fill this gap in the research by: (1) assessing the relative impact of SCV sources, and (2) proposing means to deal with them. Based on an Analytical Hierarchy Process conducted with 17 SCM practitioners, the paper assesses the relative impact of sources of SCV, and further contextualizes them according to factors such as product lead time and production strategy, providing more fine-grained insights for SC managers seeking to manage SCV. Subsequently, the paper applies the Nominal Group Technique with the same group of practitioners in order to identify and condense strategies for dealing with the most impactful sources of SCV (intra-organizational misalignment, inaccurate forecasting, long lead times, erratic behavior of decision makers in the supply chain, erratic behavior of customers, and high level of competition), leading to a set of 44 SCV-management strategies."

Artif. Intell.,6,2023,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Human-centricity is considered a central aspect in the development and governance of artificial intelligence (AI). Various strategies and guidelines highlight the concept as a key goal. However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance. Finally, the article introduces a systemic approach to ethically and socially sustainable, human-centered AI development and deployment."

By analyzing the African energy systems’ development from 2020 to 2050 for different scenarios of energy demand, land-use change, and climate impacts on water availability, we find that wind and solar outcompete hydropower by 2030. An additional 1.8 to 4% increase in annual continental investment ensures reliability against future hydroclimatic variability.

In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with educators in England to gain their perspectives on the potential use of humanoid robots with autistic pupils, eliciting ideas, and specific examples of potential use. Understanding educator views is essential, because they are key decision-makers for the adoption of robots and would directly facilitate future use with pupils. Educators were provided with several example images (e.g., NAO, KASPAR, Milo), but did not directly interact with robots or receive information on current technical capabilities. The goal was for educators to respond to the general concept of humanoid robots as an educational tool, rather than to focus on the existing uses or behaviour of a particular robot. Thirty-one autism education staff participated, representing a range of special education settings and age groups as well as multiple professional roles (e.g., teachers, teaching assistants, speech, and language therapists). Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts identified four themes: Engagingness of robots, Predictability and consistency, Roles of robots in autism education, and Need for children to interact with people, not robots. Although almost all interviewees were receptive toward using humanoid robots in the classroom, they were not uncritically approving. Rather, they perceived future robot use as likely posing a series of complex cost-benefit trade-offs over time. For example, they felt that a highly motivating, predictable social robot might increase children's readiness to learn in the classroom, but it could also prevent children from engaging fully with other people or activities. Educator views also assumed that skills learned with a robot would generalise, and that robots' predictability is beneficial for autistic children-claims that need further supporting evidence. These interview results offer many points of guidance to the HRI research community about how humanoid robots could meet the specific needs of autistic learners, as well as identifying issues that will need to be resolved for robots to be both acceptable and successfully deployed in special education contexts."

This potential is particularly marked in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), although whether it could translate into effective solutions at scale remains unclear. We discuss possible entry points for Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and mHealth approaches to violence prevention, linking these to the World Health Organization's seven INSPIRE strategies. However, such work should be approached with caution. We highlight clear directions for future work in technology-based and technology-enabled violence prevention. We argue that there is a need for good agent-based models at the level of entire cities where and when violence can occur, where local response systems are. Yet, there is a need to develop common, reliable, and valid population-and individual/family-level data on predictors of violence. These indicators could be integrated into routine health or other information systems and become the basis of Al algorithms for violence prevention and response systems. Further, data on individual help-seeking behavior, risk factors for child maltreatment, and other information which could help us to identify the parameters required to understand what happens to cause, and in response to violence, are needed. To respond to ethical issues engendered by these kinds of interventions, there must be concerted, meaningful efforts to develop participatory and user-led work in the AI space, to ensure that the privacy and profiling concerns outlined above are addressed explicitly going forward. Finally, we make the case that developing AI and other technological infrastructure will require substantial investment, particularly in LMIC."

To cope with future disruptions or epidemic outbreaks, supply chain resilience should be improved based on lessons learnt from the impacts of COVID-19 to improve supply chain resilience and facilitate the corresponding competences and skills to implement strategic changes. Method: Applying the dynamic managerial capabilities theory lens, an integrative review is conducted focused on (1) the multiple impacts of COVID-19 on the supply chain resilience, (2) multiple strategies to enhance supply chain resilience, and (3) competences needed to implement the strategic changes successfully. Result: During COVID-19, supply chains could not handle supply and demand shocks, which led to a disrupted state of supply chains. To reduce the impacts of the subsequent disruptions, companies should implement specific strategic changes and increase complementary skills and competences levels. A proposed framework indicates which skills and competences need to be developed to implement a strategic change. Conclusion: Companies must shift their focus from (cost) efficiency to creating more resilient supply chains. Additionally, purchasing professionals should develop their skills and competences accordingly to cope with future disruptions."

Many manufacturing units make unsuccessful attempts to implement lean principles in their manufacturing systems. Hence, such units must eliminate the prevailing lean barriers to accomplish successful lean implementation. Moreover, the contextual relationship of lean barriers must be studied to understand the effect of such barriers. This paper uses interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to explore lean barriers, their relationships, and their influence on other lean barriers. The present research also reveals the most significant classification of lean barriers into various categories of independent, dependent, autonomous, and linkage using the (MICMAC) Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement analysis. ISM and MICMAC together provide relationship modeling and reveal the interrelationship between each lean implementation barrier and its categories, respectively. The ISM model is validated using the Delphi technique. The interpretative ranking process (IRP) is used to rank the barriers. The three significant lean implementation barriers revealed through the IRP include “lack of lean understanding”, “lack of strong quality policy”, and “risk of sustainable practice implementation”. The present research will help practicing managers of SMEs in the manufacturing sector to understand the mutual influence of lean barriers before introducing lean implementation. It is suggested that SMEs work on independent barriers so that dependent barriers can also be overcome with the least amount of resources and effort."
