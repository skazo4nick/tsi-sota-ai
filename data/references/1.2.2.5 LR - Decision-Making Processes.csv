Explainability is one of the main obstacles that AI faces today on the way to more practical implementation. In practise, companies need to use models that balance interpretability and accuracy to make more effective decisions, especially in the field of finance. The main advantages of the multi-criteria decision-making principle (MCDM) in financial decision-making are the ability to structure complex evaluation tasks that allow for well-founded financial decisions, the application of quantitative and qualitative criteria in the analysis process, the possibility of transparency of evaluation and the introduction of improved, universal and practical academic methods to the financial decision-making process. This article presents a review and classification of multi-criteria decision-making methods that help to achieve the goal of forthcoming research: to create artificial intelligence-based methods that are explainable, transparent, and interpretable for most investment decision-makers."

As this is a developing field, it is crucial to expand discussions on topics that have not yet been thoroughly examined, such as the intrinsic bias of indicators and metrics that may be associated with specific operational, economic, environmental perspectives, etc. Such perspectives should be considered in the decision-making process within the context of reverse logistics (RL) and waste management (WM). The aim of this research was to identify different perspectives employed in the development of proposed models in the literature. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to analyze thirty papers from Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases without time restrictions. Results: The review identified various ways in which authors grouped perspectives, including qualitative and quantitative, sustainability, and operational perspectives, among others. Conclusions: This study revealed several gaps in the field, including limited studies on RSC performance assessment and a lack of studies linking performance assessment to decision-making components."

Thus, automating the thematic grouping of information may facilitate the decision making process by reducing the theme switching for a decision maker when he reads a set of messages. In this paper were used clustering techniques with multi-criteria to group the messages in themes. These criteria were implemented as configurable operators.

However, most research has studied belief formation in economic and perceptual decision making in isolation. One reason for this separate treatment may be the assumption that there are distinct psychological mechanisms that underlie belief formation in economic and perceptual decisions. An alternative theory is that there exists a common mechanism that governs belief formation in both domains. Here we test this alternative theory by combining a novel computational modeling technique with two wellknown experimental paradigms. We estimate a drift-diffusion model (DDM) and provide an analytical method to decode prior beliefs from DDM parameters. Subjects in our experiment exhibit strong extrapolative beliefs in both paradigms. In line with the common mechanism hypothesis, we find that a single computational model explains belief formation in both tasks and that individual differences in belief formation are correlated across tasks."

Robot. AI,8,2021,Frontiers Media SA,,,"The autonomous vehicle (AV) is one of the first commercialized AI-embedded robots to make autonomous decisions. Despite technological advancements, unavoidable AV accidents that result in life-and-death consequences cannot be completely eliminated. The emerging social concern of how an AV should make ethical decisions during unavoidable accidents is referred to as the moral dilemma of AV, which has promoted heated discussions among various stakeholders. However, there are research gaps in explainable AV ethical decision-making processes that predict how AVs’ moral behaviors are made that are acceptable from the AV users’ perspectives. This study addresses the key question: What factors affect ethical behavioral intentions in the AV moral dilemma? To answer this question, this study draws theories from multidisciplinary research fields to propose the “Integrative ethical decision-making framework for the AV moral dilemma.” The framework includes four interdependent ethical decision-making stages: AV moral dilemma issue framing, intuitive moral reasoning, rational moral reasoning, and ethical behavioral intention making. Further, the framework includes variables (e.g., perceived moral intensity, individual factors, and personal moral philosophies) that influence the ethical decision-making process. For instance, the framework explains that AV users from Eastern cultures will tend to endorse a situationist ethics position (high idealism and high relativism), which views that ethical decisions are relative to context, compared to AV users from Western cultures. This proposition is derived from the link between individual factors and personal moral philosophy. Moreover, the framework proposes a dual-process theory, which explains that both intuitive and rational moral reasoning are integral processes of ethical decision-making during the AV moral dilemma. Further, this framework describes that ethical behavioral intentions that lead to decisions in the AV moral dilemma are not fixed, but are based on how an individual perceives the seriousness of the situation, which is shaped by their personal moral philosophy. This framework provides a step-by-step explanation of how pluralistic ethical decision-making occurs, reducing the abstractness of AV moral reasoning processes."

This cognitive model matches well with the human predictive power statistics measuring reliance decisions; we obtain from the model an internal estimate of automation reliability that mirrors human subjective ratings. The model is able to predict the effect of various potential disruptions, such as environmental changes or particular classes of adversarial intrusions on human trust in automation. Finally, we consider the use of model predictions to improve automation transparency that account for human cognitive biases in order to optimize the bidirectional interaction between human and machine through supporting trust calibration. The implications of our findings for the design of reliable and trustworthy automation are discussed."

Individual differences in correspondence bias predict blaming people for harmful accidents, believing coerced confessions, correcting for job and task difficulty when making performance evaluations and incentive-compatible personnel selections, and separating market and fund performance when making incentive-compatible investments. Fortunately, the tendency to commit correspondence bias can be reduced. Making situational information easier to process debiases those most prone to correspondence bias."

Artif. Intell.,5,2022,Frontiers Media SA,,,"During real-time language processing, people rely on linguistic and non-linguistic biases to anticipate upcoming linguistic input. One of these linguistic biases is known as the implicit causality bias, wherein language users anticipate that certain entities will be rementioned in the discourse based on the entity's particular role in an expressed causal event. For example, when language users encounter a sentence like “Elizabeth congratulated Tina…” during real-time language processing, they seemingly anticipate that the discourse will continue about Tina, the object referent, rather than Elizabeth, the subject referent. However, it is often unclear how these reference biases are acquired and how exactly they get used during real-time language processing. In order to investigate these questions, we developed a reference learning model within the PRIMs cognitive architecture that simulated the process of predicting upcoming discourse referents and their linguistic forms. Crucially, across the linguistic input the model was presented with, there were asymmetries with respect to how the discourse continued. By utilizing the learning mechanisms of the PRIMs architecture, the model was able to optimize its predictions, ultimately leading to biased model behavior. More specifically, following subject-biased implicit causality verbs the model was more likely to predict that the discourse would continue about the subject referent, whereas following object-biased implicit causality verbs the model was more likely to predict that the discourse would continue about the object referent. In a similar fashion, the model was more likely to predict that subject referent continuations would be in the form of a pronoun, whereas object referent continuations would be in the form of a proper name. These learned biases were also shown to generalize to novel contexts in which either the verb or the subject and object referents were new. The results of the present study demonstrate that seemingly complex linguistic behavior can be explained by cognitively plausible domain-general learning mechanisms. This study has implications for psycholinguistic accounts of predictive language processing and language learning, as well as for theories of implicit causality and reference processing."

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies."

It implies greater sensitivity to losses and risk aversion when expected value is positive, but greater sensitivity to gains and risk seeking when expected value is negative. It also implies more extreme preferences when expected value is positive than when expected value is negative.

This dilemma motivates us to investigate the value of coordinating decisions on prices and capacity allocation in a stylized setting. We propose two pairs of sequential policies for making static decisions-on pricing and revenue management-that differ in their degree of integration (hierarchical versus coordinated) and their pricing inputs (deterministic versus stochastic). For a large class of stochastic, price-dependent demand models, we prove that these four heuristics admit tractable solutions satisfying intuitive sensitivity properties. We further evaluate numerically the performance of these policies relative to a fully coordinated model, which is generally intractable. We find it interesting that near-optimal performance is usually achieved by a simple hierarchical policy that sets prices first, based on a nonnested stochastic model, and then uses these prices to optimize nested capacity allocation. This tractable policy largely outperforms its counterpart based on a deterministic pricing model. Jointly optimizing price and allocation decisions for the high-end segment improves performance, but the largest revenue benefits stem from adjusting prices to account for demand risk."

Software quality assessment tools (SWQAT) promise fast and actionable insights into the technical state of software through various quality characteristics, such as maintainability, reliability, or security. These tools have been used to support a wide variety of Information Technology (IT) project management decisions related to system development, contract negotiations, project terminations, and even settling legal disputes between suppliers and clients. However, despite their rising importance, questions regarding how they function and how reliable they are to support decision-making have so far escaped scholarly attention. This paper conducts an evaluation of widely used SWQATs and analyzes how they rate the quality of software systems of varying sizes, functionalities, and programming languages. Our results reveal five key challenges for using SWQATs in IT projects. To address these challenges, we propose a design for tailorable SWQATs that allows for more conscious and prudent software quality assessments that better reflect the socio-technical aspect of software systems and the context-specific nature of software quality."

In vivo gastral images obtained by a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) were the subject of visual explanations, with the goal of increasing health professionals’ trust in black-box predictions. We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that, with future improvements in implementation, can be generalized to different medical data sets and can provide effective decision support to medical experts."

Large data volumes extracted from the banking transactions that represent customers’ behavior are available, but processing loan applications is a complex and time-consuming task for banking institutions. In 2022, over 20 million Americans had open loans, totaling USD 178 billion in debt, although over 20% of loan applications were rejected. Numerous statistical methods have been deployed to estimate loan risks opening the field to estimate whether machine learning techniques can better predict the potential risks. To study the machine learning paradigm in this sector, the mental health dataset and loan approval dataset presenting survey results from 1991 individuals are used as inputs to experiment with the credit risk prediction ability of the chosen machine learning algorithms. Giving a comprehensive comparative analysis, this paper shows how the chosen machine learning algorithms can distinguish between normal and risky loan customers who might never pay their debts back. The results from the tested algorithms show that XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy of 84% in the first dataset, surpassing gradient boost (83%) and KNN (83%). In the second dataset, random forest achieved the highest accuracy of 85%, followed by decision tree and KNN with 83%. Alongside accuracy, the precision, recall, and overall performance of the algorithms were tested and a confusion matrix analysis was performed producing numerical results that emphasized the superior performance of XGBoost and random forest in the classification tasks in the first dataset, and XGBoost and decision tree in the second dataset. Researchers and practitioners can rely on these findings to form their model selection process and enhance the accuracy and precision of their classification models."

The number of samples in each class is not uniformly distributed; one class contains a large number of samples while the other has a small number. Overfitting of the model occurs as a result of imbalanced datasets, resulting in poor performance. In this study, we compare different oversampling techniques like synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), support vector machine SMOTE (SVM-SMOTE), Border-line SMOTE, K-means SMOTE, and adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) oversampling to address the issue of imbalanced datasets and enhance the performance of machine learning models. Preprocessing significantly enhances the quality of input data by reducing noise, redundant data, and unnecessary data. This enables the machines to identify crucial patterns that facilitate the extraction of significant and pertinent information from the preprocessed data. This study preprocesses the data using various top-level preprocessing steps. Furthermore, two imbalanced Twitter datasets are used to compare the performance of oversampling techniques with six machine learning models including random forest (RF), SVM, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost (ADA), logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT). In addition, the bag of words (BoW) and term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features extraction approaches are used to extract features from the tweets. The experiments indicate that SMOTE and ADASYN perform much better than other techniques thus providing higher accuracy. Additionally, overall results show that SVM with ’linear’ kernel tends to attain the highest accuracy and recall score of 99.67% and 1.00% on ADASYN oversampled datasets and 99.57% accuracy on SMOTE oversampled dataset with TF-IDF features. The SVM model using 10-fold cross-validation experiments achieved 97.40 mean accuracy with a 0.008 standard deviation. Our approach achieved 2.62% greater accuracy as compared to other current methods."

There is a way forward -it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision."

Unfortunately, they may show ""Clever Hans""-like behavior-making use of confounding factors within datasets-to achieve high performance.In this work, we introduce the novel learning setting of ""explanatory interactive learning"" (XIL) and illustrate its benefits on a plant phenotyping research task. XIL adds the scientist into the training loop, such that she interactively revises the original model via providing feedback on its explanations. Our experimental results demonstrate that XIL can help to avoid Clever Hans moments in machine learning and encourages (or discourages, if appropriate) trust into the underlying model. 1Imagine a plant phenotyping team attempting to characterize crop resistance to plant pathogens. The plant physiologist records a large amount of hyperspectral imaging data. Impressed by the results of deep learning in other scientific areas, she wants to establish similar results for phenotyping. Consequently, she asks a machine learning expert to apply deep learning to analyze the data. Luckily, the resulting predictive accuracy is very high. The plant physiologist, however, remains skeptical. The results are ""too good, to be true"". Checking the decision process of the deep model using explainable artificial intelligence (AI), the machine learning expert is flabbergasted to find that the learned deep model uses clues within the data that do not relate to the biological problem at hand, so-called confounding factors.The physiologist loses trust in AI and turns away from it, proclaiming it to be useless. This example encapsulates a critical issue of current explainable AI [1, 2]. Indeed, the seminal paper of Lapuschkin et al.[3] helps in ""unmasking Clever Hans predictors and assessing what machines really learn"", however, rather than proclaiming, as the plant physiologist might, that the machines have learned the right predictions for the wrong reasons and can therefore not be trusted, we here showcase that interactions between the learning system and the human user can correct the model, towards making the right predictions for the right reasons [4]. This may also increase the trust in machine learning models. Actually, trust lies at the foundation of major theories of interpersonal relationships in psychology [5, 6], and we argue that interaction and understandability are central to trust in learning machines. Surprisingly, the link between interacting, explaining, and building trust has been largely ignored by the machine learning literature. Existing approaches focus on passive learning only and do not consider the interaction between the user and the learner [7,8,9], whereas, interactive learning frameworks such as active [10] and coactive learning [11] do not consider the issue of trust. In active learning, for instance, the model presents unlabeled instances to a user, and in exchange, obtains their label. This is completely opaque-the user is oblivious to the models beliefs and reasons for predictions..."

In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM’s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial.

              Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT’s) are a powerful tool for classification and regression tasks in Big Data. Researchers should be familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of current implementations of GBDT’s in order to use them effectively and make successful contributions. CatBoost is a member of the family of GBDT machine learning ensemble techniques. Since its debut in late 2018, researchers have successfully used CatBoost for machine learning studies involving Big Data. We take this opportunity to review recent research on CatBoost as it relates to Big Data, and learn best practices from studies that cast CatBoost in a positive light, as well as studies where CatBoost does not outshine other techniques, since we can learn lessons from both types of scenarios. Furthermore, as a Decision Tree based algorithm, CatBoost is well-suited to machine learning tasks involving categorical, heterogeneous data. Recent work across multiple disciplines illustrates CatBoost’s effectiveness and shortcomings in classification and regression tasks. Another important issue we expose in literature on CatBoost is its sensitivity to hyper-parameters and the importance of hyper-parameter tuning. One contribution we make is to take an interdisciplinary approach to cover studies related to CatBoost in a single work. This provides researchers an in-depth understanding to help clarify proper application of CatBoost in solving problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that studies all works related to CatBoost in a single publication."

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies."

In previous works we have shown that multi-agent search tasks can greatly benefit from intelligent cooperation between team members and can achieve performance close to the theoretical optimum. The techniques applied can be used in a variety of domains including planning against adversarial opponents, control of forest fires and coordinating search-and-rescue missions. The state-of-the-art on methods of multi-robot search across several selected domains of application is explained, highlighting the pros and cons of each method, providing an up-to-date view on the current state of the domains and their future challenges."

Robot. AI,6,2019,Frontiers Media SA,,,"This study focuses on category formation for individual agents and the dynamics of symbol emergence in a multi-agent system through semiotic communication. Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system (i.e., agent society) is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, i.e., the complete system can be regarded as a single agent performing multimodal categorization using the sensors of all agents, if we define the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence, i.e., forming and sharing signs and categories, is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the real-world environment. In the experiment, we compared three communication algorithms: no communication, no rejection, and the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher who would know a pre-existing symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system can form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing categories."

While systems that encode predictions as General Value Functions (GVFs) have seen numerous developments in both theory and application, whether such approaches are explainable is unexplored. In this perspective piece, we explore GVFs as a form of explainable AI. To do so, we articulate a subjective agent-centric approach to explainability in sequential decision-making tasks. We propose that prior to explaining its decisions to others, an self-supervised agent must be able to introspectively explain decisions to itself. To clarify this point, we review prior applications of GVFs that involve human-agent collaboration. In doing so, we demonstrate that by making their subjective explanations public, predictive knowledge agents can improve the clarity of their operation in collaborative tasks."

A challenge for traditional methods in quality management is to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear manufacturing data. We address this challenge by adapting explainable artificial intelligence to the context of quality management. Specifically, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with Shapley additive explanations to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a field experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared with the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss of 21.7%. Furthermore, we report on results from a postexperimental rollout of the decision model, which also resulted in significant yield improvements. We demonstrate the operational value of explainable artificial intelligence by showing that critical drivers of process quality can go undiscovered by the use of traditional methods.

Rather than imposing constraints or external reinforcements, agents are endowed with an elastic “sense of self” or an elastic identity that they curate based on rational considerations. This approach is called “computational transcendence (CT).” We show that agents using this model make choices for collective welfare instead of individual benefit. First, relevance of this model in game theoretic contexts like Prisoners’ dilemma and collusion is presented. Next, a generic multi-agent framework for simulating dilemmas around responsible agency is also proposed. CT implemented on this framework, is shown to be versatile in acting responsibly to different kinds of circumstances–including modifying their strategy based on their interaction with other agents in the system as well as interacting with adversaries that are rational maximizers, and who have a rationale to exploit responsible behavior from other agents. CT is also shown to outperform reciprocity as a strategy for responsible autonomy. Thus, we present CT as a framework for building autonomous agents which can intrinsically act responsibly in multi-agent systems. The core model for computational ethics presented in this paper can potentially be adapted to the needs of applications in areas like supply chains, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles. This paper hopes to motivate further research on responsible AI, by exploring computational modeling of this elusive concept called the “sense of self” that is a central element of existential inquiry in humans."

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies."

The computational approach based on FEAHP automates supplier selection by determining a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. First, the criteria and sub-criteria specific to the selection problem were identified by the experts taking the relevant literature as a starting point. Next, the experts performed a pair-wise comparison of the predefined requirements using a linguistic scale. This evaluation was then quantified by calculating the priority weights of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The best decision alternative is the one with the highest final score. Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the results of the proposed model. The FEAHP computer approach automated the supplier selection process in a rational, flexible, and agile way, as perceived by the focal company.

This study aims to facilitate the criteria identification and selection from a macro domain perspective in improving flood management planning. The objectives of this study are (a) to explore and identify potential and possible criteria to be incorporated in the current flood management plan in the macro domain perspective; (b) to understand the type of flood measures and decision goals implemented to facilitate flood management planning decisions; and (c) to examine the possible structured mechanism for criteria selection based on the decision analysis technique. Based on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis using the PESTEL framework, the findings have identified and clustered domains and their criteria to be considered and applied in future flood management plans. The critical review on flood measures and decision goals would potentially equip stakeholders and policy makers for better decision making based on a disaster management plan. The decision analysis technique as a structured mechanism would significantly improve criteria identification and selection for comprehensive and collective decisions. The findings from this study could further improve Malaysia Adaptation Index (MAIN) criteria identification and selection, which could be the complementary and supporting reference in managing flood disaster management. A proposed framework from this study can be used as guidance in dealing with and optimising the criteria based on challenges and the current application of Big Data and criteria in managing disaster events."

Addressing the challenge of diverse and unstandardized evaluation methodologies, our research develops and applies a tailored algorithm that simplifies heuristic prioritization. This novel method combines the analytic hierarchy process framework with a bespoke algorithm that leverages transitive properties for efficient pairwise comparisons, significantly reducing the evaluative workload. The algorithm is designed to facilitate the estimation of heuristic relevance regardless of the number of items per heuristic or the item scale, thereby streamlining the evaluation process. Rigorous simulation testing of this tailored algorithm is complemented by its empirical application, where seven usability experts evaluate a web interface. This practical implementation demonstrates our method’s ability to decrease the necessary comparisons and simplify the complexity and workload associated with the traditional prioritization process. Additionally, it improves the accuracy and relevance of the user interface usability heuristic testing results. By prioritizing heuristics based on their importance as determined by the Usability Testing Leader—rather than merely depending on the number of items, scale, or heuristics—our approach ensures that evaluations focus on the most critical usability aspects from the start. The findings from this study highlight the importance of expert-driven evaluations for gaining a thorough understanding of heuristic UI assessment, offering a wider perspective than user-perception-based methods like the questionnaire approach. Our research contributes to advancing UI evaluation methodologies, offering an organized and effective framework for future usability testing endeavors."

This aim is not only to promote any specific model but rather to suggest a decision-supporting tool (i.e., a prediction framework).MethodsWe analyzed a dataset of patients admitted through the ED to the “Sant”Orsola Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna, Italy, between January 1 and October 26, 2022. PLoS was defined as any hospitalization with LoS longer than 6 days. We deployed six classification algorithms for predicting PLoS: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression (LoR). We evaluated the performance of these models with the Brier score, the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F1-score. We further developed eight regression models for LoS prediction: Linear Regression (LR), including the penalized linear models Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge and Elastic-net regression, Support vector regression, RF regression, KNN, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression. The model performances were measured by their mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean relative error. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%).ResultsA total of 12,858 eligible patients were included in our study, of whom 60.88% had a PloS. The GB classifier best predicted PloS (accuracy 75%, AUC 75.4%, Brier score 0.181), followed by LoR classifier (accuracy 75%, AUC 75.2%, Brier score 0.182). These models also showed to be adequately calibrated. Ridge and XGBoost regressions best predicted LoS, with the smallest total prediction error. The overall prediction error is between 6 and 7 days, meaning there is a 6–7 day mean difference between actual and predicted LoS.ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of machine learning-based methods to predict LoS and provide valuable insights into the risks behind prolonged hospitalizations. In addition to physicians' clinical expertise, the results of these models can be utilized as input to make informed decisions, such as predicting hospitalizations and enhancing the overall performance of a public healthcare system."

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies."

Thus, decision-makers have abundantly available alternatives to choose from the best one or rank from the most to the least preferred. However, in the multicriteria decision-making field, most tools support a limited number of alternatives with as narrow criteria as possible. Decision-makers are forced to apply a screening or filtering method to reduce the size of the problem, which will slow down the process and eliminate some potential alternatives from the rest of the decision-making process. Implementing MCDM methods in high-performance parallel and distributed computing environments becomes crucial to ensure the scalability of multicriteria decision-making solutions in Big Data contexts, where one can consider a vast number of alternatives, each being described on the basis of a number of criteria.In this context, we consider TOPSIS one of the most widely used MCDM methods. We present a parallel implementation of TOPSIS based on the MapReduce paradigm. This solution will reduce the response time of the decision-making process and facilitate the analysis of the robustness and sensitivity of the method in a high-dimension problem at a reasonable response time.Three multicriteria analysis problems were evaluated to show the proposed approach's computational efficiency and performance.

               A generalization of technique for establishing order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting based on the redefinition of intuitionistic fuzzy sets theory (A IFS) in the framework of Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) of evidence is proposed. The use of DST mathematical tools makes it possible to avoid a set of limitations and drawbacks revealed recently in the conventional Atanassov’s operational laws defined on intuitionistic fuzzy values, which may produce unacceptable results in the solution of multiple criteria decision-making problems. This boosts considerably the quality of aggregating operators used in the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method. It is pointed out that the conventional TOPSIS method may be naturally treated as a weighted sum of some modified local criteria. Because this aggregating approach does not always reflects well intentions of decision makers, two additional aggregating methods that cannot be defined in the framework of conventional A IFS based on local criteria weights being intuitionistic fuzzy values, are introduced. Having in mind that different aggregating methods generally produce different alternative rankings to obtain the compromise ranking, the method for aggregating of aggregation modes has been applied. Some examples are used to illustrate the validity and features of the proposed approach."

Methods: To this end, a literature review was carried out in the area and a survey was developed with professionals through a structured questionnaire. The collected data were treated using the TOPSIS multi-criteria technique. Results: The results indicate that the performance objectives in route plans “level of service”, “total number of vehicles” and “total distance travelled” are the ones that, in the opinion of the professionals participating in the research, have greater importance in the planning and elaboration of plan routes and that such objectives directly impact the sustainable results of a given organization. Conclusions: The results can serve as a basis for researchers in the area who aim to broaden the debates on this topic and for logistics operations managers who work directly with planning and elaboration of route plans and who aim to make their operations more sustainable. Therefore, this research addresses the literature gap by identifying which performance objectives should be considered in the elaboration of route plans and how they relate to sustainability guidelines.

Specifically, we propose to adapt the explanatory interactive machine-learning approach Caipi for fair machine learning. FairCaipi incorporates human feedback in the loop on predictions and explanations to improve the fairness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that FairCaipi outperforms a state-of-the-art pre-processing bias mitigation strategy in terms of the fairness and the predictive performance of the resulting machine-learning model. We show that FairCaipi can both uncover and reduce bias in machine-learning models and allows us to detect human bias."

It is also important to create favorable conditions for economic activity while respecting the environment. One of the most important dimensions of this concept is security in the broadest sense, particularly that which concerns urban residents. This article addresses this subject by analyzing crime and determining the state of safety in 16 Polish provincial cities between 2013–2022. The measure of this state was chosen to be a set of indicators characterizing a number of registered criminal and economic offenses in the studied cities. On this basis, values of the indices of the dynamics of change for these offenses in individual cities in the analyzed period were determined. In the next stage, the number of offenses was compared to the number of residents of the cities under study and the indices of concentration for total offenses (LQT) and for individual types of offenses (LQn) were determined. Based on these results, the studied cities were divided into four concentration levels. Afterward, these results were used for a multi-criteria analysis of the safety of studied cities, which was carried out using the TOPSIS method. The calculated values of the safety index (Pi) formed the basis for creating a ranking and specifying security levels of studied cities. The results indicate a wide variation among the cities in terms of safety levels. Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn and Zielona Góra were found to be the safest cities, while Szczecin was found to be the least safe. The methodology developed and the results obtained show the validity of conducting comparative research in areas relevant to the implementation of the smart cities concept. The knowledge gained can be used to build strategies and conduct policies with regard to improving safety in cities, especially those aspiring to be smart cities."

Robot. AI,11,2024,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Introduction: Multi-agent systems are an interdisciplinary research field that describes the concept of multiple decisive individuals interacting with a usually partially observable environment. Given the recent advances in single-agent reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has gained tremendous interest in recent years. Most research studies apply a fully centralized learning scheme to ease the transfer from the single-agent domain to multi-agent systems.Methods: In contrast, we claim that a decentralized learning scheme is preferable for applications in real-world scenarios as this allows deploying a learning algorithm on an individual robot rather than deploying the algorithm to a complete fleet of robots. Therefore, this article outlines a novel actor–critic (AC) approach tailored to cooperative MARL problems in sparsely rewarded domains. Our approach decouples the MARL problem into a set of distributed agents that model the other agents as responsive entities. In particular, we propose using two separate critics per agent to distinguish between the joint task reward and agent-based costs as commonly applied within multi-robot planning. On one hand, the agent-based critic intends to decrease agent-specific costs. On the other hand, each agent intends to optimize the joint team reward based on the joint task critic. As this critic still depends on the joint action of all agents, we outline two suitable behavior models based on Stackelberg games: a game against nature and a dyadic game against each agent. Following these behavior models, our algorithm allows fully decentralized execution and training.Results and Discussion: We evaluate our presented method using the proposed behavior models within a sparsely rewarded simulated multi-agent environment. Although our approach already outperforms the state-of-the-art learners, we conclude this article by outlining possible extensions of our algorithm that future research may build upon."

However, we observe that rewards learned naively tend to lack insightful structure, which causes them to produce undesirable behavior when optimized in games with different players from those encountered during training. We further investigate conditions under which rewards or utility functions can be precisely identified, on problem domains such as normal-form and Markov games, as well as auctions, where we show we can learn reward functions that properly generalize to new settings."

representing and solving distributed combinatorial problems, where the
variables of the problem are owned by different agents. Many multi-agent
problems include constraints that produce different gains (or costs) for the
participating agents. Asymmetric gains of constrained agents cannot be
naturally represented by the standard DCOP model. The present paper proposes a
general framework for Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs). In ADCOPs different agents may
have different valuations for constraints that they are involved in. The new
framework bridges the gap between multi-agent problems which tend to have
asymmetric structure and the standard symmetric DCOP model. The benefits of the
proposed model over previous attempts to generalize the DCOP model are
discussed and evaluated. Innovative algorithms that apply to the special
properties of the proposed ADCOP model are presented in detail. These include
complete algorithms that have a substantial advantage in terms of runtime and
network load over existing algorithms (for standard DCOPs) which use
alternative representations. Moreover, standard incomplete algorithms (i.e.,
local search algorithms) are inapplicable to the existing DCOP representations
of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new ADCOP framework
they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results. The
local search algorithms proposed in the present paper converge to high quality
solutions. The experimental evidence that is presented reveals that the
proposed local search algorithms for ADCOPs achieve high quality solutions

However, most of the research on this topic is concerned with the way people behave and the connection to spatial layouts. It ignores the fact that in outdoor spaces, microclimate factors tend to have a more important impact on human behavior. In this study, microclimate factors were narrowed down into two main factors: outdoor thermal perception and sunshine perception. Both of these factors are integrated into the traditional MAS, together with visual perception as the influence factors of agent action. The new MAS was developed in Processing language and can dynamically and visually show agents activities in the space. Taking Gulou Square in Nanjing, China, as a case, the simulations were carried out with three typical meteorological days of spring equinox, summer solstice, and winter solstice. Through comparing the simulation results at different times, we found that the new MAS exhibits a significant impact of microclimate on human behavior.

Robot. AI,9,2022,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Multi-agent task allocation methods seek to distribute a set of tasks fairly amongst a set of agents. In real-world settings, such as soft fruit farms, human labourers undertake harvesting tasks. The harvesting workforce is typically organised by farm manager(s) who assign workers to the fields that are ready to be harvested and team leaders who manage the workers in the fields. Creating these assignments is a dynamic and complex problem, as the skill of the workforce and the yield (quantity of ripe fruit picked) are variable and not entirely predictable. The work presented here posits that multi-agent task allocation methods can assist farm managers and team leaders to manage the harvesting workforce effectively and efficiently. There are three key challenges faced when adapting multi-agent approaches to this problem: (i) staff time (and thus cost) should be minimised; (ii) tasks must be distributed fairly to keep staff motivated; and (iii) the approach must be able to handle incremental (incomplete) data as the season progresses. An adapted variation of Round Robin (RR) is proposed for the problem of assigning workers to fields, and market-based task allocation mechanisms are applied to the challenge of assigning tasks to workers within the fields. To evaluate the approach introduced here, experiments are performed based on data that was supplied by a large commercial soft fruit farm for the past two harvesting seasons. The results demonstrate that our approach produces appropriate worker-to-field allocations. Moreover, simulated experiments demonstrate that there is a “sweet spot” with respect to the ratio between two types of in-field workers."

In multi-agent path finding (MAPF), it is usually assumed that planning is performed centrally and that the destinations of the agents are common knowledge. We will drop both assumptions and analyze under which conditions it can be guaranteed that the agents reach their respective destinations using implicitly coordinated plans without communication. Furthermore, we will analyze what the computational costs associated with such a coordination regime are. As it turns out, guarantees can be given assuming that the agents are of a certain type. However, the implied computational costs are quite severe. In the distributed setting, we either have to solve a sequence of NP-complete problems or have to tolerate exponentially longer executions. In the setting with destination uncertainty, bounded plan existence becomes PSPACE-complete. This clearly demonstrates the value of communicating about plans before execution starts.&#x0D;

Robot. AI,6,2019,Frontiers Media SA,,,"This study focuses on category formation for individual agents and the dynamics of symbol emergence in a multi-agent system through semiotic communication. Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system (i.e., agent society) is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, i.e., the complete system can be regarded as a single agent performing multimodal categorization using the sensors of all agents, if we define the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence, i.e., forming and sharing signs and categories, is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the real-world environment. In the experiment, we compared three communication algorithms: no communication, no rejection, and the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher who would know a pre-existing symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system can form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing categories."

               Since their development, social media has grown as a source of information and has a significant impact on opinion formation. Individuals interact with others and content via social media platforms in a variety of ways, but it remains unclear how decision-making and associated neural processes are impacted by the online sharing of informational content, from factual to fabricated. Here, we use EEG to estimate dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks and probe the neural changes underlying opinion change (or formation) within individuals interacting with a simulated social media platform. Our findings indicate that the individuals who changed their opinions are characterized by less frequent network reconfigurations while those who did not change their opinions tend to have more flexible brain networks with frequent reconfigurations. The nature of these frequent network configurations suggests a fundamentally different thought process between intervals in which individuals are easily influenced by social media and those in which they are not. We also show that these reconfigurations are distinct to the brain dynamics during an in-person discussion with strangers on the same content. Together, these findings suggest that brain network reconfigurations may not only be diagnostic to the informational context but also the underlying opinion formation."

These findings provide new insights on the role that language plays in financial reporting decisions and on how relationships with major stakeholders influence the relation between an important feature of language and corporate income smoothing behavior.

Research suggests the existence of a gap between theoretical frameworks and practice. Although current ITG research is largely focused on hard governance (structure, processes), soft governance (behavior, collaboration) is equally important and might be crucial to close the gap. The goal of this study is to evaluate the usability of a new ITG maturity instrument that covers hard and soft ITG in detail. We conducted ten case studies and evaluated the instrument positively on usability; but feedback also revealed that the assessment questions needed improvements. We demonstrate that combining the instrument with structured interviews results in an enhanced and usable instrument to determine an organization’s current level of hard and soft ITG. We conclude that this new instrument demonstrates a way to reduce the mismatch between ITG maturity theory and practice."

We test this prediction by using a measure of investor overconfidence derived from the characteristics and holdings of U.S. equity mutual fund managers. We find that firms with more overconfident investors are relatively overvalued based on the market-tobook ratio and a misvaluation measure. The result is stronger among stocks with greater mutual fund ownership, particularly by active mutual funds. Firms with more overconfident investors also exhibit lower subsequent stock returns, issue more equity, and invest more.

Consequently, the issue of supplier evaluation and selection (SES), which is one of the most critical decisions in SCM, has gained special significance and has been examined from various perspectives. The concept of green and resilient (gresilient) SCM has emerged in response to recent concerns about environmentally friendly production and operations, as well as organizations’ ability to cope with crises and disasters. In the rapidly growing construction industry, applying gresilient principles can ensure green operations and help overcome future challenges. Methods: This study focuses on gresilient SES in a real-world construction case study, proposing a streamlined FUCOM (S-FUCOM) approach. The proposed method streamlines traditional FUCOM processes to solve decision-making problems in deterministic and uncertain environments. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate its applicability. Results: the case study results identify air emissions, environmental management systems, and restorative capacity as the most critical gresilient SES criteria. Conclusions: The third supplier emerged as the top performer based on decision-making indicators. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted across 20 scenarios, demonstrating that S-FUCOM is robust and provides stable results."

While research has predominantly focused on describing the multidimensional areas of SCV and its negative impacts, clear guidelines on how to manage SCV for efficiency, and prioritize the areas on which to focus, are sparse. This study seeks to fill this gap in the research by: (1) assessing the relative impact of SCV sources, and (2) proposing means to deal with them. Based on an Analytical Hierarchy Process conducted with 17 SCM practitioners, the paper assesses the relative impact of sources of SCV, and further contextualizes them according to factors such as product lead time and production strategy, providing more fine-grained insights for SC managers seeking to manage SCV. Subsequently, the paper applies the Nominal Group Technique with the same group of practitioners in order to identify and condense strategies for dealing with the most impactful sources of SCV (intra-organizational misalignment, inaccurate forecasting, long lead times, erratic behavior of decision makers in the supply chain, erratic behavior of customers, and high level of competition), leading to a set of 44 SCV-management strategies."

Artif. Intell.,5,2022,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies."

A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements.

Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance. In order to do so, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis on a sample of 172 European companies. We find that firms that opt for a centralized governance structure, as well as larger firms, are more likely to attain a state of procurement alignment. Furthermore, our results empirically support the statement that procurement alignment is positively correlated with operational efficiency and competitive performance of the supply chain."

In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed."

Findings: The findings highlight the key benefits of effective knowledge transfer in supply chain systems by identifying risks associated with supply chain networks. Conclusion: The balanced power of facilitating knowledge transfer in supply chain processes helps in supply chain partnerships and reduces the supply chain complexity. This paper has both theoretical and practical contributions as it adds to the literature by identifying the factors of supply chain complexity drivers which are impacting the knowledge transfer."

This last decision is needed to ensure traceability and visibility of the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the main public and private supply chain security management programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: A qualitative and quantitative research methodology based on thematic content analysis is followed. The four main existing security programs in Latin America and the Caribbean are systematically compared and a common general framework is developed. Results: The analysis shows a high degree of similarity between the levels of security contained in the selected programs. Conclusions: We found that there is little guidance available for companies interested in managing security risks in their supply chains through these logistics’ security programs. This article contributes to the literature on logistics security programs that is currently gaining momentum in managing security risks in global supply chains and provides academic insights into the choice and/or complementarity of one or more logistics security programs."

One possible strategy to address these challenges for smoothing the supply chain (SC) and logistics operations is to adopt Industry 4.0 (I4.0) based technologies in the FMCG business processes. In this regard, digitalization and automation of the FMCG supply chain can be strengthened by the alluring properties of I4.0 technologies. Methods: This study identified nine significant challenges through a literature review and expert validation. Later, the challenges were evaluated using a novel multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) framework, the Bayesian best worst method (BWM). Results: The findings indicated that “requirement for substantial investment and resources”, “incompatible technological infrastructure” and “poorly structured value chain” are the most significant challenges to implementing I4.0 in the FMCG industry. Conclusions: The study is expected to significantly contribute to improving the FMCG supply chain’s resilience, sustainability, visibility, traceability and responsiveness. Additionally, the research can provide industrial practitioners valuable insights into implementing I4.0 in FMCG and similar sectors and thus promote SC sustainability and resilience in those industries."

Still, there seems to be no common understanding of the term in scientific literature. Moreover, the broad field of LSCM allows for a multitude of feasible application areas and use cases, yet there exists no conclusive list of them as to date. Methods: This study builds upon a systematic literature review of 66 DSCT articles to identify application areas of DSCT in LSCM as well as specific use cases and their respective intended benefits. Results: To start with, the study derives a unified definition of DSCTs, including possible scopes of applications. Afterwards, five application areas of DSCT in LSCM are synthesized as well as 14 individual use cases and their respective intended benefits. Conclusions: The study leads towards a conceptual clarification of DSCT that is of importance for research and practice alike. For managers it additionally provides up-to-date use cases to guide DSCT applications in practice."

Methods: A hybrid approach combining qualitative and quantitative data analysis was adopted. The research was divided into two phases: (i) identification of critical factors based on the literature, and (ii) analysis of eight experts’ insights on those factors by employing the grey DEMATEL approach. Results: Fourteen factors that affect trust in the wine supply chain were identified based on the academic literature. From the analysis of the experts’ views, with the use of the grey DEMATEL approach, the factors were classified into two groups. The first group (nine factors) concerns the factors that affect the rest and the second group (five factors) concerns those which are affected by the former factors. Conclusions: The study of trust in the supply chain can be further improved by monitoring the trends in the sector and by engaging a wider audience of stakeholders. This approach can be applied to various regions in order to examine whether the situation is different from country to country. Stakeholders will have the necessary information to support their decisions and prioritize their objectives, aiming at improving the whole supply chain."

Despite extensive research on decision-making under risk, little is known about how risks are actually perceived by financial professionals, the key players in global financial markets. In a large-scale survey experiment with 2,213 finance professionals and 4,559 lay people in nine countries representing ∼50% of the world's population and more than 60% of the world's gross domestic product, we expose participants to return distributions with equal expected return and we systematically vary the distributions' next three higher moments. Of these, skewness is the only moment that systematically affects financial professionals' perception of financial risk. Strikingly, variance does not influence risk perception, even though return volatility is the most common risk measure in finance in both academia and the industry. When testing other, compound risk measures, the probability to experience losses is the strongest predictor of what is perceived as being risky. Analyzing professionals' propensity to invest, skewness and loss probability have strong predictive power too. However, volatility and kurtosis also have some additional effect on participants' willingness to invest. Our results are very similar for lay people, and they are robust across and within countries with different cultural backgrounds as well as for different job fields of professionals."

Robot. AI,7,2021,Frontiers Media SA,,,"As autonomous machines, such as automated vehicles (AVs) and robots, become pervasive in society, they will inevitably face moral dilemmas where they must make decisions that risk injuring humans. However, prior research has framed these dilemmas in starkly simple terms, i.e., framing decisions as life and death and neglecting the influence of risk of injury to the involved parties on the outcome. Here, we focus on this gap and present experimental work that systematically studies the effect of risk of injury on the decisions people make in these dilemmas. In four experiments, participants were asked to program their AVs to either save five pedestrians, which we refer to as the utilitarian choice, or save the driver, which we refer to as the nonutilitarian choice. The results indicate that most participants made the utilitarian choice but that this choice was moderated in important ways by perceived risk to the driver and risk to the pedestrians. As a second contribution, we demonstrate the value of formulating AV moral dilemmas in a game-theoretic framework that considers the possible influence of others’ behavior. In the fourth experiment, we show that participants were more (less) likely to make the utilitarian choice, the more utilitarian (nonutilitarian) other drivers behaved; furthermore, unlike the game-theoretic prediction that decision-makers inevitably converge to nonutilitarianism, we found significant evidence of utilitarianism. We discuss theoretical implications for our understanding of human decision-making in moral dilemmas and practical guidelines for the design of autonomous machines that solve these dilemmas while, at the same time, being likely to be adopted in practice."

Intell.,4,2021,Frontiers Media SA,,,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize the healthcare system, leading to enhance efficiency by automatizing routine tasks and decreasing health-related costs, broadening access to healthcare delivery, targeting more precisely patient needs, and assisting clinicians in their decision-making. For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT’s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs’ exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system."

During evacuations the sharing of resources and vehicles is a crucial mechanism for expanding critical capacity and enabling inclusive disaster response. This paper examines the complexity of rideshare decision-making in the wake of simultaneous emergencies. Specifically, the need for physical distancing measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic complicates face-to-face resource sharing between strangers. The ability of on-demand ridesharing to provide emergency transportation to individuals without access to alternatives calls for an understanding of how evacuees weigh risks of contagion against benefits of spontaneous resource sharing. In this research, we examine both sociodemographic and situational factors that contribute to a willingness to share flood evacuation rides with strangers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the willingness to share is significantly correlated with traditional emergency resource sharing motivations and current COVID-19 risk factors. To test these hypotheses, we distributed an online survey during the pandemic surge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern states in the United States with high risk of flooding. We estimate a random parameter multinomial logit model to determine the willingness to share a ride as a driver or passenger. Our findings show that willingness to share evacuation rides is associated with individual sociodemographics (such as being female, under 36 years old, Black, or republican-identifying) and the social environment (such as households with children, social network proximity, and neighborly sharing attitudes). Moreover, our findings suggest higher levels of income, COVID-19 threat perception, evacuation fear, and household preparedness all correspond with a lower willingness to share rides. We discuss the broader implications of emergency on-demand mobility during concurrent disasters to formulate strategies for transportation agencies and on-demand ridehailing providers."

Intell.,5,2022,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies."

The model integrates two key characteristics of R&amp;D investment: accelerability (i.e., higher R&amp;D intensity leads to faster discovery) and scalability (i.e., higher R&amp;D intensity leads to higher project payoff). I find that firms react strategically to their rivals’ financial constraints when making investment decisions in a duopoly R&amp;D race. In particular, firms respond positively to the R&amp;D intensity of an unconstrained rival, while they respond in a hump-shaped fashion to the R&amp;D intensity of a constrained rival. As a result, a constrained firm can pre-empt an unconstrained competitor in market equilibrium. Accelerability is necessary for such pre-emption to occur, and scalability generally reduces its likelihood. Comparison with a monopoly benchmark shows that the economic mechanism differs from over-investment induced by financial constraints alone. The model also generates new implications regarding how project characteristics and cash flow risks impact R&amp;D decisions.  This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance."

To address these usability-related issues, in this work we focus on the cognitive dimension of users’ perception of explanations and XAI systems. We investigated these perceptions in light of their relationship with users’ characteristics (e.g., expertise) through a questionnaire-based user study involved 44 cardiology residents and specialists in an AI-supported ECG reading task. Our results point to the relevance and correlation of the dimensions of trust, perceived quality of explanations, and tendency to defer the decision process to automation (i.e., technology dominance).
