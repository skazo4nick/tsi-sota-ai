SMEs are considered vulnerable economic agents due to their financial constraints and reduced viability compared to large firms. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review, identifying key challenges in the research and generating a future research agenda. Design/methodology/approach A structured literature review was conducted in this study, resulting in the identification of 106 articles that relate to construction SME risks. Thematic analysis was then employed to determine the supply chain risk themes. Additionally, VOSviewer was employed to depict content frequency and, most recently, trends based on the timeline. Findings This paper uncovers eight distinct supply chain risks pertinent to construction SMEs, arranging these into three themes from the standpoint of supply chain risk management. Moreover, it identifies six gaps in the existing body of research on construction SMEs and puts forth prospective research directions and questions to address each of these identified gaps. Originality/value The practical significance of this study is to provide SMEs in the construction industry with a comprehensive framework for identifying and categorizing risks related to management and strategy, operations and processes and sustainability.

Tate']","ABSTRACT World‐renowned chefs achieve culinary excellence by mastering diverse cooking techniques and specialized tools. Similarly, supply chain management (SCM) faces complex and dynamic research phenomena that defy simple methods. This editorial argues that SCM researchers need to expand their methodological toolkit of quantitative data collection and analysis approaches. Although traditional quantitative data collection and analysis methods have advanced SCM theory, they impose limitations on capturing real‐world complexities. Issues like retrospective bias, the cross‐sectional nature of data, the inability to replicate managerial dynamics, and constraints in network‐level analysis hinder theoretical development. Moreover, dominant data analysis techniques struggle to accommodate temporal dynamics, multilevel interactions, and causal inferences. To overcome these constraints, this editorial advocates the need for promising but underutilized research methods: field experiments, neuroscience methods, agent‐based modeling, SIENA, dynamic SEM, multilevel models, QCA, and AI‐based methods. By expanding the methodological “kitchen tools,” researchers can generate more powerful, convincing, and comprehensive theories about supply chain decision‐making and performance.","['Business', 'Supply chain management', 'Supply chain', 'Process management', 'Operations management', 'Marketing']",agent supply chain management,2025-06-05T11:17:50.043890

Musallam', 'Sujit Sheth', 'Thomas D. Coates', 'Hanny Al‐Samkari', 'Maria Domenica Cappellini', 'Kevin H.M. Kuo', 'Vip Viprakasit', 'Alì Taher']","Our understanding of the molecular pathways and associated clinical presentations characterizing various thalassemia phenotypes has substantially improved over the years. Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) refers to patients who present with mild–moderate anemia, which does not necessitate lifelong, regular transfusion therapy. This typically includes patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, mild–moderate hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia, and α-thalassemia intermedia (hemoglobin H disease) (Figure 1) [1-7]. The underlying α/non-α globin chain imbalance and subsequent ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis lead to chronic anemia, primary iron overload, and a hypercoagulable state. These, in turn, are associated with a range of clinical morbidities that can impact quality of life and lead to premature death (Figure 2) [2, 8-22]. In view of the growing evidence on the negative impact of untreated anemia in these patients, long-term management becomes key. However, the only options that have been available so far include transfusions which can worsen iron overload and introduce transfusion-dependence burden, off-label use of hydroxyurea based on data from small trials or observational studies, and splenectomy which is associated with increased risks of infections and thrombosis (Figure 3) [6, 9, 23, 24]. Beyond anemia, cumulative iron overload due to increased intestinal iron absorption needs to be regularly monitored and managed with iron chelation therapy. Multimorbidity in NTDT also requires close monitoring and early intervention through a multidisciplinary team approach (Figure 4) [2, 6, 25-27]. In the last decade, we have witnessed several novel agents being developed to manage anemia in NTDT. Agents targeting hepcidin dysregulation have not been successful in clinical trials, despite encouraging data in animal models. Luspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent, showed efficacy in improving hemoglobin level in adults with β-NTDT and is now approved in Europe (but not the United States). Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator, has also shown efficacy in improving hemoglobin level and functional status in a recent phase 3 trials in adult patients with both α- and β-NTDT (Figure 5) [24, 28-30]. Clinical management guidelines are now available, but awareness of the various morbidities and treatment options in NTDT, especially among patients remains essential (a patient friendly summary is provided in the Appendix S1).

The proposed MAS-ML framework improves flexibility, adaptability, and predictiveness in essential roles in supply chain management (SCM), including demand forecasting, inventory management, production planning, and SCM logistics. The framework is based on decentralised decision-making where each agent is responsible for a particular supply chain activity but employs real-time data foresight from the ML model to streamline the activities. This decentralisation enables resilience in supply chains, which can experience events such as demand variability and transportation disruptions. MAS-ML is presented in this paper as the solution capable of enhancing supply chain performance, reliability, and cost optimisation in situations characterised by risk and uncertainty, such as the current global pandemic. In addition, this paper presents potential research areas, such as the integration of more enhanced deep learning algorithms, the extension of proposing MAS-ML into other sectors, and the addressing of ethical and transparency concerns associated with AI-based decision-making systems. The proposed MAS-ML framework improves the adaptability and resiliency of supply chains, providing a flexible solution for modern supply chain problems.","['Resilience (materials science)', 'Supply chain', 'Computer science', 'Process management', 'Risk analysis (engineering)', 'Business', 'Artificial intelligence']",agent supply chain management,2025-06-05T11:17:50.044430

The object of this research is the halal supply chain for micro-scale potato chip enterprises, involving suppliers, producers, and retailers. The final product's halal status may be at risk caused by factors like sourcing raw materials, production processes, storage, distribution, and halal management at various supply chain phases. The problem to be solved is to develop a comprehensive institutional model of the potato chip supply chain, identify and assess these halal-related risks, map risk agents based on risk events, and develop alternative mitigation strategies to minimize potential threats. To accomplish this, an integrated methodology, including the House of Risk (HoR) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodologies, is implemented. The findings reveal the identification of 69 risk events and 70 risk agents, all associated with planning, purchasing, production, and distribution. Thirty priority risk agents requiring immediate attention were determined using the Pareto Diagram and ISM. Based on the ISM analysis, risk agents were categorized into independent and dependent variables within the potato chip business cluster. The integration of HoR and ISM effectively prioritizes risk agents and uncovers their interrelationships, enabling robust mitigation strategies. The approved approach provides a comprehensive risk assessment framework, allowing producers to control the main risk factors affecting halal product integrity, and enhance consumer trust.

We show that RL can significantly improve ordering efficiency and overall supply chain performance. The model environment is adapted for the OpenAI 'gymnasium' interface with the usage of reward shaping (reward engineering) in the model training process. The algorithm employs two reward function components: costs and order variance metric. We evaluate the effectiveness of RL against Order-Up-To inventory management policies for several supply chain configurations and assess the impact on the overall supply chain stability. An algorithm based on a recurrent proximal policy optimisation (RPPO) is effective for the beer game setup and outperforms Order-Up-To approaches. This RL algorithm generates different ordering patterns and tends to narrow the action space for the agent and thus, to mitigate the bullwhip effect in a more effective way. Our findings suggest that an improvement in the reduction of the bullwhip effect impact is present even if only one agent in the supply chain uses the algorithm as an ordering policy.","['Bullwhip effect', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Reinforcement', 'Computer science', 'Game theory', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Economics', 'Operations research', 'Microeconomics', 'Engineering']",agent supply chain management,2025-06-05T11:17:50.044681

This study aims to identify risks in the sustainable supply chain in the palm oil industry and formulate risk mitigation measures, both preventive and corrective, using the House of Risk approach and the MOORA decision support system. The literature review results indicate deforestation, harvest gaps between communities and companies, stagnant productivity, and issues of desire that influence Government policies.

While existing approaches employ statistical and machine learning methods for demand forecasting, they often fail to capture complex temporal dependencies and lack the ability to simultaneously optimize inventory decisions. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes demand forecasting and inventory management in retail supply chains, leveraging data from IoT sensors, RFID tracking systems, and smart shelf monitoring devices. Our approach combines transformer-based sequence modeling for demand patterns with hierarchical reinforcement learning agents that coordinate inventory decisions across distribution networks. The framework integrates both historical sales data and real-time sensor measurements, employing attention mechanisms to capture seasonal patterns, promotional effects, and environmental conditions detected through temperature and humidity sensors. Through extensive experiments on large-scale retail datasets incorporating sensor network data, we demonstrate that our method achieves 18.2% lower forecast error and 23.5% reduced stockout rates compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The results show particular improvements in handling promotional events and seasonal transitions, where traditional methods often struggle.

Should people behave completely rational, they would cease to engage the moment there is visibility on one’s earnings from the conflict. However, in reality the observable patterns and trends are different given that not always are people engaging rationally. What makes this complex is the fact that many a times a person does not have the required information to be able to engage in a fair play.

The proposed game models the belief system of the players regarding their opponent as a Markov chain and in doing so incorporates uncertainty in the form of entropy of information. The proposed model is illustrated using a single manufacturer, single supplier game. The results show that in the presence of uncertainty, players are willing to tradeoff a part of their winnings to accumulate as much information about the opponent as they seem satisfactory.

The focus is on single-level assembly systems, where both component delivery lead times and finished product demand are subject to randomness. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which an agent determines optimal order quantities for each component by accounting for stochastic lead times and demand variability. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is adapted and employed to learn optimal replenishment policies over a fixed planning horizon. To enhance learning performance, we develop a tailored simulation environment that captures multi-component interactions, random lead times, and variable demand, along with a modular and realistic cost structure. The environment enables dynamic state transitions, lead time sampling, and flexible order reception modeling, providing a high-fidelity training ground for the agent. To further improve convergence and policy quality, we incorporate local search mechanisms and multiple action space discretizations per component. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces stockouts and overall costs while improving the system’s adaptability to uncertainty.

To achieve this, nodes in the network often form symbiotic relationships as they can be adversely effected by the closure of companies in the network, especially where products are niche. However, balancing support for other nodes in the network against profit is challenging. Agents are increasingly being explored to define optimal strategies in these complex networks. However, to date much of the literature focuses on homogeneous agents where a single policy controls all of the nodes. This isn't realistic for many supply chains as this level of information sharing would require an exceptionally close relationship. This paper therefore compares the behaviour of this type of agent to a heterogeneous structure, where the agents each have separate polices, to solve the product ordering and pricing problem. An approach to reward sharing is developed that doesn't require sharing profit. The homogenous and heterogeneous agents exhibit different behaviours, with the homogenous retailer retaining high inventories and witnessing high levels of backlog while the heterogeneous agents show a typical order strategy. This leads to the heterogeneous agents mitigating the bullwhip effect whereas the homogenous agents do not. In the high demand environment, the agent architecture dominates performance with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agents outperforming the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agents. Here, the factory controls the supply chain. In the low demand environment the homogenous agents outperform the heterogeneous agents. Control of the supply chain shifts significantly, with the retailer outperforming the factory by a significant margin.","['Supply chain', 'Business', 'Competitive advantage', 'Computer science', 'Process management']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.433409

The ERP serves as a high-quality data foundation, and several other internal and external sources can provide essential data with varying quality. Methods: The proposed AI model builds upon the Weighted Dynamic Corridor Price Optimization framework, which integrates cost-plus and value-based pricing methodologies within a non-linear price corridor bounded by lower and upper thresholds. In the context of supply chain integration, fully-cooperative pricing models can apply Nash equilibrium to enhance supply chain profitability, whilst semi-cooperative models mitigate information asymmetry through the principal-agent theory.

Despite their benefits, these methods often require large amounts of interaction and data to converge, which leads to a high communication time, especially if the agents are distributed around the world. To address this issue, we propose a distributed surrogate model for DS-based federated MaRL to utilize the surrogate model instead of DS during the training.

The authors develop an agentic theory of union resourcefulness based on these findings, which complements extant structural arguments. Drawing on theories of ideational power resources, they show how sensemaking processes are central to marshaling and (re)creating power resources. This theorization of resourcefulness helps to explain outcome variation in unions’ ongoing struggle for influence in globalized production.","['Corporate governance', 'Inclusion (mineral)', 'Supply chain', 'Business', 'European union']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.434032

Unlike classical decision models, this enhanced framework explicitly captures feedback learning, subjective uncertainty, and self-reflective judgment, enabling a more realistic simulation of strategic behaviour under radical uncertainty. Traditional decision theories often rely on assumptions of rational agents, stable preferences, and complete information. However, in real-world contexts such as crises, complex markets, or adversarial environments, such conditions are rarely met. The enhanced SDEM integrates three core extensions to reflect cognitive and strategic diversity: (1) the availability of multiple context-sensitive heuristics, (2) a dynamic adjustment of the decision threshold based on experience, and (3) a meta-cognitive uncertainty parameter that regulates decision-making based on subjective confidence. These additions allow for the formal inclusion of adaptive learning, bounded rationality, and self-reflective judgement in decision processes. The paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of the model, discusses its implications for cognitive modelling and agent-based simulations, and illustrates its functionality through practical examples. Potential applications include cybersecurity, strategic intelligence, supply chain resilience, and energy markets. The proposed framework enables realistic modelling of heterogeneous behaviour in multi-agent environments and offers new insights into dynamic adaptation under uncertainty.","['Adaptation (eye)', 'Cognition', 'Heuristic', 'Meta heuristic', 'Computer science', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Meta-analysis', 'Psychology', 'Management science', 'Cognitive science']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.434107

Using a grounded theorizing effort, based on open, in-depth interviews with 88 buyer and supplier agents from a variety of organizations, our research reveals a multi-level process by which work relationships emerge and enable formalized cooperative understandings. First, the findings shed light on how early stage work relationships in markets of customizable differentiated products/services are designed and delineate that the genesis of buyer–supplier relationships lies in early interaction between individual agents of buyers and suppliers. Second, relationships between individuals, amplified by relational affect, can lead to authenticity, conductive through sharing of rich-context information to alignment of interests between the respective parties. Third, relational authenticity and the alignment of interests can serve as the foundation for understanding between buyers and suppliers at the organizational level, attained through co-active issue-selling efforts.","['Process (computing)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Business', 'Variety (cybernetics)', 'Knowledge management', 'Order (exchange)', 'Relational view', 'Supply chain', 'Work (physics)', 'Marketing']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.434234

However, the current research has been struggling to strike a balance between strain specificity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. Here, we propose a bacterial cell wall-specific antibacterial strategy based on an in situ engineered nanocomposite consisting of carbon substrate and decorated TiOx dots, termed TiOx@C. The fiber-like carbon substrate of TiOx@C is able to penetrate the bacterial membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), but not that of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) due to its thicker bacterial wall, thus achieving bacterial wall specificity. Furthermore, a series of experiments demonstrate the specific electro-mechanical co-sterilization effect of TiOx@C. On the one hand, TiOx@C can disrupt the electron transport chain and block the energy supply of S. aureus. On the other hand, TiOx@C capable of destroying the membrane structure of P. aeruginosa could cause severe mechanical damage to P. aeruginosa as well as inducing oxidative stress and protein leakage. In vivo experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TiOx@C in eliminating 97% of bacteria in wounds and promoting wound healing in wound-infected female mice. Overall, such a bacterial cell wall-specific nanomedicine presents a promising strategy for non-antibiotic treatments for bacterial diseases. Personalized antibacterial agents against diverse bacteria strains are promising for combating antimicrobial resistance, but a balance between strain specificity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity is elusive.

The study explores the nature and structure of the Supply Chain distribution of Rice, tracing the changes in the level of prices in Pampanga. Relevant Quantitative cost data were derived from 10 farmers in Pampanga, who are farming land from 1 to 2 hectares. Other relevant data that make up the distribution system of rice in the market were sourced from the interviews conducted with agents, millers, wholesalers and retailers in the province. Secondary data from related literature, government and other agencies in agriculture and cooperatives were also interviewed for the needed data in the study. Results show that the estimated total cost of milled rice is Php 17.17 (manual) and Php17.28 (tractor), without yet the mark-up for profit, taking into account that farmers take the role of producers and sellers to end- users. If farmers choose to sell their produce at Php 20.00 kilo, the estimated profit is total to Php 8,490.00 (manual) and Php 8, 160.00 (tractor) for one hectare of land in one cropping which falls under the income range of Filipino families living under poverty threshold. Thus, satisfying the call for Php 20.00/kilo of rice, will further sink the Rice farmers’ families into the pit of poverty.

J. Parker', 'Ivan Trus', 'William G. Cance']","e23529 Background: Sarcoma treatment relies on doxorubicin- or ifosfamide-based regimens, or combinations like gemcitabine and docetaxel. While genomic testing and other biomarkers can sometimes guide targeted therapies, in many sarcoma cases, functional profiling of ex-vivo tumor tissue might be the only way to personalize cancer treatment. To do so, we developed a multi-dimensional profiling platform to quantify cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of NCCN-recommended therapies on fresh sarcoma specimens. Methods: Fresh sarcoma tissues from five patients were shipped on a cooled supply chain, processed within 24 hours, and 3D-cultured to mimic the patient's tumor microenvironment. Samples were treated with NCCN-recommended therapies at sub-pharmacologic to supra-pharmacologic concentrations for three days. Drug efficacy was assessed via metabolic and image-based 3D analyses, measuring 50% reductions (EC50s) in tumor viability (cytotoxicity) and proliferation (cytostatic effects), and patient reports were issued to the oncologist within 7-10 days. Results: EC50 values for both effects were measured for up to 30 drugs across five patients, varying by over two orders of magnitude. Anti-proliferative EC50s were typically over an order of magnitude lower than cytotoxic EC50s. While drugs like gemcitabine, sorafenib, and sunitinib were presumed to be more cytostatic, and platinum agents, actinomycin, and lurbinectedin were presumed more cytotoxic, actual ratios of those EC50 responses varied widely. These differences did not align with drug classes or presumed mechanisms of action, underscoring sarcoma heterogeneity and the limitations of relying solely on biomarkers or single-dimensional drug response data. Conclusions: This is the first study systematically comparing ex vivo anti-proliferative and cytotoxic profiles in live sarcoma tissues. Conventional chemosensitivity assays focusing on just one endpoint may oversimplify treatment decisions, whereas multi-dimensional functional profiling offers a more rational approach to personalized sarcoma therapy. Standardized EC50 for cytotoxicity and antiproliferation for NCCN guideline recommended therapies.

Such an all-3D-printed strain sensor exhibits excellent sensing performance enabling precise detection of minor strains in plant growth, including high stretchability (&gt; 300%), high sensitivity (~12.78) with good linearity (0.98), and good long-term stability over 3,000 loading/unloading cycles. We further validate the potential applications of our 3D-printed integrated strain sensor for accurate and continuous monitoring of bamboo growth in both horizontal and vertical directions over 14 days. Our all-3D-printed strain sensor offers a promising avenue for integrated strain sensing systems toward plant growth monitoring.","['Sensitivity (control systems)', 'Strain (injury)', 'Biomedical engineering', 'Materials science', 'Computer science']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.435487

It consists of diverse cell types, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules that interact to promote tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Elucidating the intricate interactions between cancer cells and the TME is crucial in understanding cancer progression and therapeutic challenges. A critical process induced by TME signaling is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), wherein epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal traits, which enhance their motility and invasiveness and promote metastasis and cancer progression. By targeting various components of the TME, novel investigational strategies aim to disrupt the TME's contribution to the EMT, thereby improving treatment efficacy, addressing therapeutic resistance, and offering a nuanced approach to cancer therapy. This review scrutinizes the key players in the TME and the TME's contribution to the EMT, emphasizing avenues to therapeutically disrupt the interactions between the various TME components.

Furthermore, enhancing the willingness of participants to engage in this system has emerged as a critical issue requiring urgent resolution. This study assumes bounded rationality and constructs an evolutionary game model to analyze the adoption behaviors of logistics service providers (LSPs) and logistics service integrators (LSIs) in a blockchain environment. The stability theorem of differential equations is employed to elucidate the inherent decision-making mechanisms present in the game. Acknowledging that traditional evolutionary mechanisms often neglect individual heterogeneity and the dynamic changes in the topological structures of complex networks, this study further involves the development of an evolutionary game model tailored for the complex network of a regional logistics service supply chain. After validating the effectiveness of the model, this research investigates how market environmental factors influence the adoption behaviors of LSPs and LSIs. Finally, through case simulations, the effects of key influencing factors on participatory behaviors within the regional logistics service supply chain are analyzed. The findings indicate that, in a blockchain environment, both prior to and following the adoption of complex network technology in the regional logistics service supply chain, the equilibrium stability of the network system is jointly determined by the total revenues of LSPs and LSIs. External factors in the blockchain environment significantly influence technology adoption strategies. Notably, when both the sensitivity coefficients of market demand relative to price and logistics service costs concerning quality enhancement are high, the willingness of supply chain participants to adopt the technology declines rapidly. As the quality elasticity increases, the technology adoption rates of providers and integrators initially stabilize and subsequently increase exponentially. Changes in the revenues of logistics service providers have no significant impact on technology adoption rates within the regional logistics service supply chain.","['Supply chain', 'Service (business)', 'Evolutionary game theory', 'Service provider', 'Business', 'Supply chain network', 'Computer science', 'Supply chain management', 'Environmental economics', 'Game theory']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.435682

This review investigates the multidimensional role of AI in the pandemic, which arises as a global health crisis, and its role in preparedness and responses, ranging from enhanced epidemiological modelling to the acceleration of vaccine development. The confluence of AI technologies has guided us in a new era of data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and treat infectious illnesses. The review begins by discussing the impact of a pandemic on emerging countries worldwide, elaborating on the critical significance of AI in epidemiological modelling, bringing data-driven decision-making, and enabling forecasting, mitigation and response to the pandemic. In epidemiology, AI-driven epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) are applied to predict the spread of disease, preventing outbreaks and optimising vaccine distribution. The review also demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics improve our knowledge of disease propagation patterns. The collaborative aspect of AI in vaccine discovery and clinical trials of various vaccines is emphasised, focusing on constructing AI-powered surveillance networks. Conclusively, the review presents a comprehensive assessment of how AI impacts epidemiological modelling, builds AI-enabled dynamic models by collaborating ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, and develops and implements vaccines and clinical trials. The review also focuses on screening, forecasting, contact tracing and monitoring the virus-causing pandemic.

The conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals not only mitigates atmospheric CO2 levels but also optimizes carbon resource utilization. Enzyme-catalyzed carbon technology offers a green and efficient approach to CO2 conversion. However, free enzymes are prone to inactivation and denaturation under reaction conditions, which limit their practical applications. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) serve as effective carriers for enzyme immobilization, offering porous crystalline structures that enhance enzyme stability. Moreover, their high specific surface area facilitates strong gas adsorption, making enzyme@MOF composites particularly advantageous for CO2 catalytic conversion. In this paper, we review the synthesis technologies and the application of enzyme@MOFs in CO2 catalytic conversion. Furthermore, the strategies, including the enhancement of CO2 utilization, coenzyme regeneration efficiency, and substrate mass transfer efficiency, are also discussed to further improve the efficiency of enzyme@MOFs in CO2 conversion.

Consequently, inventory management in cold chains should prioritise both profitability and environmental sustainability. This paper optimises inventory in a cold chain system consisting of a single warehouse and retail outlet, responsible for storing and selling cold items, respectively. To maintain product quality and safety, these items must be transported and stored in temperature-controlled environments. Two inventory models for the proposed cold chain are formulated and compared under two distinct carbon emissions regulations, namely, cap-and-trade and cap-and-offset, using both financial and environmental metrics. The proposed models factor in carbon emissions from refrigerated trucks and warehouses used for transporting and storing cold inventory. This study examines both a numerical example and a real case study involving a frozen seafood supply chain. The numerical analysis reveals that cap-and-trade regulation is more effective in reducing environmental impact, leading to 4.4% lower carbon emissions compared to carbon cap-and-offset regulation. However, from an economic standpoint, carbon cap-and-offset regulation performs marginally better, generating a 1% higher profit. The study identifies three key factors that significantly influence both financial and environmental outcomes in the cold chain: truck capacity, fuel efficiency, and freezer performance. As a result, management can best improve profitability and reduce emissions in cold chain operations by focusing on optimising these critical elements.","['Sizing', 'Theory of computation', 'Operations research', 'Inventory management', 'Business', 'Chain (unit)', 'Computer science', 'Carbon fibers', 'Environmental economics', 'Operations management']",multi-agent supply chain,2025-06-05T11:17:53.436042

As warehouses become complex labyrinths with robots dedicated to various tasks, heuristic methods become indispensable. Based on experience and intuition, these methods offer shortcuts to solving complex challenges, enabling rapid decisions without resorting to exhaustive research. The recent research, based on pre-established rules and previous experience, has found that heuristic methods are difficult to adapt quickly to frequent changes in logistical fields. The heuristic methods are weak when faced with new situations requiring frequent change. These constraints allow us to migrate to reinforcement learning, which introduces a dynamic and continuous path in logistics environments, unlike static heuristic methods. In this environment, this paper aims to provide agents with intelligent and structured strategies to manage navigation efficiently in such dynamic logistic environments, and to meet the challenges of modern warehouses and their respective targets in real time. To achieve this, we have hybridized the BAT algorithm of Meta heuristics and reinforcement learning algorithms, which will yield remarkable results.","['Reinforcement learning', 'Warehouse', 'Computer science', 'Scalability', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Distributed computing']",agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:56.656768

This study examines the PDP-TW in an urban logistics context using an integrated approach that combines an agent-based simulation model and an optimization model. The research focuses on a real-world case study, comparing the company’s current operational scenario with an optimized scenario generated through a PDP-TW model adapted from the literature. The findings reveal that the optimized model reduced the total distance traveled by approximately 38%, while the simulated optimized scenario achieved a reduction of about 36.5%. Consequently, the total cost decreased from EUR 116.50 in the real-world operations to EUR 71.21 in the optimization model and EUR 73.29 in the simulated optimal real scenario. Additionally, the optimized approach required only two drivers instead of three, indicating potential efficiency gains in resource allocation. In the optimization model, window constraints were strictly satisfied. However, in the agent-based simulation, a few deliveries were completed within the 10 min empirical tolerance threshold, rather than within the scheduled window itself. This outcome underscores the need for enhanced scheduling strategies to increase time window robustness under real-world execution variability.

An enhanced state representation captures vehicle positions, battery constraints, and inter-agent interactions. The actor-critic network employs deep residual layers and agent identity encoding to support dynamic adaptation and coordination. A Dijkstra-based module ensures drone reachability under energy constraints, while a task allocation mechanism balances delivery loads and prevents conflicts. Experiments on synthetic and real-world-inspired datasets demonstrate the proposed model’s superiority over single-agent PPO and classical metaheuristics in terms of delivery time, energy efficiency, and scalability. As the number of agents and delivery nodes grows, the system maintains high performance, demonstrating strong potential for real-time autonomous logistics in urban environments.","['Travelling salesman problem', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Drone', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Mathematical optimization', 'Reinforcement', '2-opt']",agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:56.657553

In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of response delays in a logistics network. We find that at our problem scale, trucks are the preferred mode when only monetary costs are considered.

Despite the growing focus on sustainability, limited research explicitly addresses green warehouses and their environmental impact. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying key factors for creating a green warehouse and developing an innovative rating model. Design/methodology/approach Focusing on the Italian logistics real estate sector, which is experiencing growth in both contract logistics and real estate, this research identifies 22 key sustainability factors. These factors are validated using the Delphi methodology, involving 22 experts selected from real estate agents, property developers, investors, 3PLs and academics. Then, the model was applied to a sample of 35 warehouses, providing an initial sustainability assessment. Findings The results reveal significant variability in the importance assigned to sustainable practices for warehouses. The study also highlights specific sustainability factors frequently overlooked in the literature, underscoring the limitations of traditional green certifications not specifically tailored to warehousing. Originality/value This research proposes a novel rating model designed to meet the sustainability needs of warehouses, distinguishing it from existing certifications that lack warehouse-specific criteria. From an academic perspective, it fills gaps in knowledge about the sustainability of logistics real estate, while from a business perspective, it provides a practical tool for logistics managers to assess and prioritise sustainability investments.

This study evaluates the role of government management and aviation transport infrastructure in the air freight logistics service chain, with an empirical investigation conducted in Vietnam. Data was collected through surveys of 700 enterprises that had shipped goods via air freight forwarders or air cargo agents. Measurement scales were assessed using Cronbach’s Alpha, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and hypothesis testing through structural equation modelling. The analysis results indicate that government management of air logistics positively influences air cargo handling and forwarding services as well as air freight transport services. Aviation transport infrastructure significantly affects air cargo handling and forwarding services and air freight transport services. Moreover, air cargo handling and forwarding services positively impact air freight transport services. Both air cargo handling and forwarding services, along with air freight transport services, strongly influence the operational efficiency of the air freight logistics service chain.

The research is aimed at planning military attacks with drones to provide for establishing military parity of forces in a military conflict zone. Therefore, the actual topic of the proposed publication, which explores the sequence of military logistics actions for planning and implementing wave attacks to inflict maximum damage on the enemy, is relevant. The goal of this publication is to create a set of mathematical, simulation and agent-based models that can be used to study and plan attack missions by waves of swarms of attack drones. This article analyzes the existing problems of using a new innovative technological tool of warfare in the form of a swarm of attack drones. A systematic analysis of military logistics for conducting massive attacks with strike drones is carried out. A set of strategies for using a swarm of drones on the battlefield is formed. Possible actions related to launching drones, forming a swarm in flight, and dividing the swarm into groups with their movement to separate enemy targets are considered. Risks of enemy military threats (use of electronic warfare, anti-drone warfare, etc.) that affect the formation of routes and the possible destruction of a portion of attack drones on approach to targets are taken into account. The swarm is rationally divided into groups in flight, considering the combat potential required to defeat the enemy’s current targets. A sequence of drone swarm waves is formed depending on the level of target damage (partial damage, complete damage). When planning each wave of the drone flight, one of the proposed strategies is used. Much attention is paid to the formation of flight routes for attack drones to ensure the suddenness of a massive attack despite enemy military threats. An algorithm for generating the shortest flight route in time despite enemy anti-drone operations has been developed. A map of the air situation on the battlefield with a set of separate local zones that have different values of threat risks is formed. The route is planned considering the military risks of each local zone. A simulation model was created to study the movement of attack drones to enemy targets in time. An agent-based model is being developed to plan military logistics actions for conducting wave attacks on enemy targets using swarms and groups of attack drones. An illustrated example of planning the flight routes of a swarm of attack drones is presented, taking into account the risks of military threats. The scientific innovation of the study is related to the solution of the actual scientific and applied problem of planning the missions of a swarm of attack drones to ensure successful operational and tactical actions on the battlefield.

While background studies have primarily addressed socio-economic needs and strategies to overcome these long-standing challenges, supply chain coordination remains critical for enhancing efficiency and sustainability. This study examined the impact of joint decision-making mechanisms on the logistical performance of a citrus food supply chain in Colombia. Methods: We employed agent-based modeling and simulation to evaluate three scenarios: single distribution (the current system referred to as Single-distribution), joint consolidation (Joint-consolidation), and joint consolidation–distribution (Joint-consolidation-distribution). Key performance indicators, including total logistics costs, Staytime, and load capacity utilization, were analyzed to evaluate the scenarios. Results: The joint-consolidation–distribution model emerged as the most effective, reducing logistical costs, improving load utilization, and increasing farmers’ revenues by 55.9% compared to individual sales. Consolidating harvest and distribution through a food hub improved efficiency by centralizing logistics and reducing the reliance on middlemen. Conclusions: Our findings provide actionable insights into how joint coordination enhances smallholder farmers’ economic outcomes, strengthens supply chain sustainability, and fosters community development.

AI-powered negotiation agents revolutionize both by deploying real-time rate benchmarking, dynamic discount negotiation, and risk-adjusted pricing. For spot freight (1 in 5 loads), agents instantly align quotes with $150 billion in market data, keeping rates within 5% of the median ($50-$100/load savings), replacing hours of emails with seconds of precision. In RFPs, this shrinks timelines from months to days. Agents also negotiate spot discounts e.g., 7% off $1,000/load for 200 annual spot loads ($14,000 savings) and embed risks like 15% fuel swings into terms (e.g., 4% surcharge), ensuring stability across both channels. These innovations cut manual effort, boost transparency, and optimize profitability for shippers, brokers, and carriers. Despite hurdles like data access and adoption, AI negotiation agents herald a pricing future that unifies spot and contract logistics into an agile, data-driven ecosystem.","['Negotiation', 'Business', 'Spot market', 'Blind spot', 'Industrial organization', 'Spot contract']",agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:56.659281

Accurate forecasting not only enhances delivery efficiency and reduces operational costs but also supports key decisions such as warehouse scheduling, route optimization, and resource allocation. Effectively capturing the temporal dynamics of material flow under complex and variable traffic and weather conditions has emerged as a crucial research focus in the field of intelligent logistics. This study proposes a material flow prediction method based on a TCN-GRU deep fusion model, aiming to improve prediction accuracy and enhance the ability to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in time series data. The model is evaluated using the Amazon Delivery Dataset, which comprises 43,632 delivery records across multiple cities, including detailed information on orders, delivery agents, weather, traffic conditions, and delivery performance metrics, providing a solid foundation for analyzing multivariate interactions affecting material flow. Focusing on the city of Chennai, India, this research particularly examines the impact of weather conditions on delivery performance and validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) component efficiently extracts local temporal features, while the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) is adept at modeling long-term dependencies. Together, they enable the model to better capture complex temporal patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.860 in predicting material flow, outperforming traditional time series forecasting methods and showing clear advantages in both prediction accuracy and generalization capability.","['Task (project management)', 'Fusion', 'Flow (mathematics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science']",agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:56.659447

It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.","['Sigma', 'Pathfinding', 'Sheaf', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Computer science', 'Algebra over a field']",agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:56.659691

Multi-agent AI systems, especially when combined with advanced large language models (LLMs), are gaining traction across various industries including healthcare, finance, logistics, and cybersecurity due to their capacity for complex reasoning, interactive communication, and real-time data processing. Demonstrating their robust applicability, this paper presents three practical case studies within petroleum engineering: oilfield data summarization, automated pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) table correction, and machine learning-based rock type classification from wireline log data. In the first case study, a multi-agent system is deployed to emulate a multidisciplinary team comprising domain-specific agents—including geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists, reservoir engineers, and production technologists. These agents collaboratively synthesize extensive oilfield data into structured summaries, drastically reducing manual processing time and enhancing the accuracy of insights. The second study illustrates how a specialized multi-agent crew effectively automates the analysis and correction of black oil PVT data. By extracting, validating, and adjusting PVT datasets to separator conditions, the system improves the reliability of fluid-property data crucial for reservoir modeling, substantially minimizing human-induced errors. The third case study addresses automated rock classification by leveraging data analytics and neural network modeling. Agents systematically analyze and interpret wireline log data, accurately classifying rock types into lithofacies. This approach significantly improves interpretative consistency and analytical efficiency compared to traditional manual methods. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that multi-agent AI systems not only replicate complex petroleum engineering workflows but enhance them by automating repetitive tasks, reducing errors, and providing high-quality decision support. The implementation of multi-agent systems thus represents a robust step forward in the digital transformation of oil and gas field development, fostering greater operational agility, resilience, and innovation.","['Robot', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Multi-agent system', 'Engineering', 'Engineering management', 'Knowledge management']",agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:56.659870

The study delineates the high energy demands and ecological burdens of food production, trade, and consumption through a comprehensive bibliographic analysis of high-impact research papers, authoritative reports, and databases. The paper systematically analyzes and synthesizes data to characterize the food industry’s current energy use patterns and environmental impacts. The results underscore a pressing need for strategic interventions to enhance food system efficiency and reduce the footprint. In light of the projected population growth and increasing food demand, the study advocates for a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and resilient food production practices, adopting energy-efficient technologies, promoting sustainable dietary habits, and strengthening global cooperation among stakeholders to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Investigations have revealed that the food system is highly energy-intensive, accounting for approximately 30% of total energy consumption (200 EJ per year). The sector remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which constitute 26% of all anthropogenic emissions, have shown a linear growth trend, reaching 16.6 GtCO2eq in 2015 and projected to approach 18.6 GtCO2eq in the coming years. Notably, 6% of these emissions result from food never consumed. While the water footprint has slightly decreased recently, its demand is expected to increase by 20% to 30%, potentially reaching between 5500 and 6000 km3 annually by 2050. Energy efficiency interventions are estimated to save up to 20%, with a favorable payback period, as evidenced by several practical implementations.","['Carbon footprint', 'Sustainability', 'Ecological footprint', 'Greenhouse gas', 'Food systems', 'Natural resource economics', 'Food processing', 'Environmental economics', 'Energy consumption', 'Footprint']",autonomous agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:59.987386

A novel framework is proposed, combining Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, specifically applied to the ABB IRB120, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) industrial manipulator, for pick-and-place tasks in warehouse automation. The methodology employs an actor–critic RL architecture with a 27-dimensional state input and a 6-dimensional joint action output. The RL agent was trained using MATLAB’s Reinforcement Learning Toolbox and integrated with ABB’s RobotStudio simulation environment via TCP/IP communication. LQR controllers were incorporated to optimize joint-space trajectory tracking, minimizing energy consumption while ensuring precise control. The novelty of this research lies in its synergistic combination of RL and LQR control, addressing energy efficiency and precision simultaneously—an area that has seen limited exploration in industrial robotics. Experimental validation across 100 diverse scenarios confirmed the framework’s effectiveness, achieving a mean positioning accuracy of 2.14 mm (a 28% improvement over traditional methods), a 92.5% success rate in pick-and-place tasks, and a 22.7% reduction in energy consumption. The system demonstrated stable convergence after 458 episodes and maintained a mean joint angle error of 4.30°, validating its robustness and efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of RL for broader industrial applications. The demonstrated accuracy and success rate suggest its applicability to complex tasks such as electronic component assembly, multi-step manufacturing, delicate material handling, precision coordination, and quality inspection tasks like automated visual inspection, surface defect detection, and dimensional verification. Successful implementation in such contexts requires addressing challenges including task complexity, computational efficiency, and adaptability to process variability, alongside ensuring safety, reliability, and seamless system integration.

This promising service delivery pathway, endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), is hindered by concerns of poor-quality care. Simulated clients collected data on MA pill dispensing practices from 92 pharmacies and chemist shops in three Nigerian states and 127 pharmacies in an Indian state that we have anonymized. Guided by the WHO’s abortion guideline, we measured process-related quality indicators such as medication use instructions, warning signs, and respectful treatment among other aspects. We aggregated indicators under three domains: technical competence, information given to clients, and client experience. Overall, 51% of facilities in the Nigerian states and 32% in the Indian state offered MA pills. Most dispensing facilities offered the misoprostol-only regimen in Nigeria (68%) and the combination regimen in the Indian state (83%). Among facilities offering MA pills, 26% in Nigeria and 78% in the Indian state provided correct instructions on route of pill administration. Accurate information on the appropriate interval between pill type in the combination regimen was low in Nigeria (27%) and the Indian state (14%). Excessive bleeding as a warning sign was discussed more frequently in the Indian (56%) versus Nigerian states (32%); other abnormal bleeding patterns were rarely mentioned. Aggregate technical competency scores were low at 18% in Nigeria and 34% in the Indian state, with highest scores for client experience at 90% and 91% respectively. Findings suggest that people using MA pills purchased from the retail market are not given accurate and adequate information for most effective self-use.

Monitoring biomass yield and quality traits directly impacts the fertilization and irrigation practises and frequency of utilization (cuts) in grasslands. Therefore, the main goal of the review is to examine the techniques for using PA applications to monitor productivity and quality in forage and grasslands. To achieve this, the authors discuss several monitoring technologies for biomass and plant stand characteristics (including quality) that make it possible to adopt digital farming in forages and grassland management. The review provides an overview about mass flow and impact sensors, moisture sensors, remote sensing-based approaches, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and mapping field heterogeneity and promotes decision support systems (DSSs) in this field. At a small scale, advanced sensors such as optical, thermal, and radar sensors mountable on drones; LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging); and hyperspectral imaging techniques can be used for assessing plant and soil characteristics. At a larger scale, we discuss coupling of remote sensing with weather data (synergistic grassland yield modelling), Sentinel-2 data with radiative transfer modelling (RTM), Sentinel-1 backscatter, and Catboost–machine learning methods for digital mapping in terms of precision harvesting and site-specific farming decisions. It is known that the delineation of sward heterogeneity is more difficult in mixed grasslands due to spectral similarity among species. Thanks to Diversity-Interactions models, jointly assessing various species interactions under mixed grasslands is allowed. Further, understanding such complex sward heterogeneity might be feasible by integrating spectral un-mixing techniques such as the super-pixel segmentation technique, multi-level fusion procedure, and combined NIR spectroscopy with neural network models. This review offers a digital option for enhancing yield monitoring systems and implementing PA applications in forages and grassland management.

Eight essential criteria are identified, such as the use of renewable energy, the efficiency of production, and the health and safety of workers, to evaluate energy performance. Using the entropy method for criterion weighting and the CRADIS technique for alternative ranking, we prioritize a range of energy-efficient solutions. The novelty of our approach lies in its comprehensive assessment of complex real-world energy management scenarios within smart factories, offering a robust and adaptable decision-support tool. Our empirical results, validated through sensitivity analysis, show that alternative 5 delivers the most significant improvement in energy efficiency. This study provides valuable information for industry practitioners seeking to transition to more sustainable production methods and supports the broader sustainability agenda.","['Multiple-criteria decision analysis', 'Efficient energy use', 'Computer science', 'Weighting', 'Sustainability', 'Energy management', 'Ranking (information retrieval)', 'Risk analysis (engineering)', 'Operational excellence', 'Management science']",autonomous agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:59.988537

Kaminka', 'Yinon Douchan']","Introduction Inspired by natural phenomena, generations of researchers have been investigating how a swarm of robots can act coherently and purposefully, when individual robots can only sense and communicate with nearby peers, with no means of global communications and coordination. In this paper, we will show that swarms can perform better, when they self-adapt to admit heterogeneous behavior roles. Methods We model a foraging swarm task as an extensive-form fully-cooperative game, in which the swarm reward is an additive function of individual contributions (the sum of collected items). To maximize the swarm reward, previous work proposed using distributed reinforcement learning, where each robot adapts its own collision-avoidance decisions based on the Effectiveness Index reward ( EI ). EI uses information about the time between their own collisions (information readily available even to simple physical robots). While promising, the use of EI is brittle (as we show), since robots that selfishly seek to optimize their own EI (minimizing time spent on collisions) can actually cause swarm-wide performance to degrade. Results To address this, we derive a reward function from a game-theoretic view of swarm foraging as a fully-cooperative, unknown horizon repeating game. We demonstrate analytically that the total coordination overhead of the swarm (total time spent on collision-avoidance, rather than foraging per-se) is directly tied to the total utility of the swarm: less overhead, more items collected. Treating every collision as a stage in the repeating game, the overhead is bounded by the total EI of all robots. We then use a marginal-contribution (difference-reward) formulation to derive individual rewards from the total EI .

Recognizing their potential, especially in cases where conventional healthcare cannot address the multifaceted impact of conditions such as in Parkinson's disease (PD), our study advocates for an integrative approach in medical practice and neuroscience. We recommend incorporating learning environments from the design phase through long-term care. The arts offer a unique opportunity to create such environments. In this study, we specifically focus on individuals with PD, co-designing an intervention as a creative engagement learning environment and a PD-specific creative arts therapy. In this study, the narratives of those affected contribute as scientific knowledge, shaping care and increasing the intervention's relevance to participants' lives. We used a participatory design-based research approach. Fourteen individuals with PD, along with three creative therapists and three researchers, collaborated through iterative design cycles to co-develop a creative arts therapy intervention. Qualitative data were collected through interviews, group reflections, and ethnographic observations. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. The co-creation process resulted in a 10-week creative engagement intervention delivered in a ""creative playground"" setting. Participants chose from multiple media and autonomously decided their creative activities. Guidance from the creative therapists was provided as needed to support individual engagement and guide reflection and learning processes. Narratives offered insights into the relevance of autonomy in care, the role of the arts, and the individuality of disease experience, resulting in seven key features of our intervention framework, which include (i) intervention structure (e.g., duration of the intervention and sessions), (ii) freedom in selection of creative media, (iii) environment as a creative playground, (iv) skills of creative therapists, (v) PD-specific considerations, (vi) financial considerations and logistics, and we list (vii) responsibilities of the Design Team. This study establishes an initial framework for a PD-specific creative arts therapy intervention designed as a creative engagement learning environment.

Over time, data-driven principles have been reframed as the foundations for the development of a new mind-set that considers data as a key asset that redesigns entrepreneurship and encompasses orientation, culture and human resources management to help entrepreneurs catch, evaluate and launch entrepreneurial opportunities that can improve technology and knowledge by stimulating innovation. For this reason, the study aims at reconceptualizing entrepreneurship according to a multi-levelled perspective based on the integration of cultural, human, knowledge-based and technological dimension to assess the impact of data-driven management on entrepreneurial opportunities creation and on the development of different kinds of innovation. To assess these goals, empirical research based on constructivist grounded theory and on the administration of semi-structured interviews is performed through the investigation of an Italian public–private Consortium specialized in big data. The findings allow the elaboration of a conceptual framework which classifies the activities of data-driven entrepreneurial processes, the phases of opportunity creation and the different kinds of innovation enabled in the Consortium by guiding entrepreneurs and managers in the elaboration of effective data analysis strategies.","['Entrepreneurship', 'Knowledge creation', 'Knowledge management', 'Business']",autonomous agent logistics,2025-06-05T11:17:59.989034

The study also explores the mediating mechanisms, moderating effects, and heterogeneity across cities. The main findings are as follows: (1) The low-carbon city pilot policies significantly reduce carbon emission intensity, with the impact becoming stronger and more stable over time. (2) The reduction in carbon intensity is partially mediated by enhanced carbon sink levels and industrial structure upgrades, although technological investment does not have a significant effect. (3) Environmental regulations negatively moderate the policy’s effectiveness, while fiscal freedom and population growth rates positively influence its impact. (4) The effects of the policy are heterogeneous across cities, driven by differences in economic levels, geographical locations, industrial bases, resource endowments, and population sizes.

This study aims to contribute to the conceptualization of DT planning—the early stage of the DT lifecycle—focusing on the road transportation sector, particularly road physical twin planning within the AEC industry. To achieve this, we reviewed the relevant literature defining DT planning. We also examined stakeholders’ relevant guidelines and documents from national bodies that roadmap the road DT planning process to understand the scope and identify knowledge gaps. Based on the findings, mapping the existing road planning process to the constituents of road DT planning was performed for the applicable planning steps. Finally, we proposed a five-layered road DT planning framework that will roadmap future implementations comprising data acquisition, data processing, data modeling and algorithms, data analysis and control, and a service layer plus users.

Rheological properties, including yield stress, plastic viscosity, and thixotropy, play indispensable roles in optimizing the workability, stability, and overall performance of cement composites. This review explores the effects of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), chemical admixtures, nanomaterials, and internal curing agents on modulating rheological properties. Specifically, SCMs, including fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and silica fume (SF), generally improve the rheology of concrete while reducing the cement content and CO2 emissions. Regarding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizers (SPs), viscosity-modifying agents (VMAs), setting-time control agents, and superabsorbent polymers (SAPs), they further optimize flow and cohesion, addressing issues such as segregation and early-age shrinkage. Nanomaterials, including nano-silica (NS) and graphene oxide (GO), can enhance viscosity and mechanical properties at the microstructural level.

The traditional approach to controlling crystal size involves adding pure lactose to induce microcrystallisation. A cost‐effective alternative is milk permeate, a by‐product of milk ultrafiltration with up to 90% lactose. This study evaluates milk permeate as a nucleating agent compared with pure lactose, aiming to improve SCM texture and reduce costs. This study assessed the ability of milk ultrafiltration (UF) permeate to induce lactose crystallisation in SCM compared with pure lactose powder. The influence of micronised and non‐micronised forms on crystal size, number and viscosity over 30 days was also examined. The samples were produced using whole milk and sucrose in a laboratory‐scale rotary evaporator. Four treatments were applied: (T1) non‐micronised lactose, (T2) micronised lactose, (T3) non‐micronised UF permeate and (T4) micronised UF permeate. Crystallisation was monitored using optical microscopy and analysed with ImageJ software at 1, 7, 15 and 30 days. Viscosity was measured with a rotational viscometer and a Ford cup viscometer. Statistical analysis was performed using Tukey's test ( P &lt; 0.05). Micronised ingredients (T2 and T4) formed smaller (~11 μm) and more numerous (~700 crystals/microscopic field) crystals than non‐micronised treatments (~15 μm, ~200 crystals/microscopic field). UF permeate showed similar nucleation capacity to pure lactose without altering viscosity. Viscosity increased over time, with T4 showing the highest values at day 30. Smaller, more numerous crystals in micronised treatments reduced the risk of a sandy texture. Milk UF permeate can replace pure lactose as a nucleating agent in SCM, offering a cost‐effective alternative without compromising quality. Micronised permeate is especially effective, producing a smooth‐textured product like traditional formulations. This innovation could enhance industry competitiveness by reducing costs and waste while maintaining quality.","['Lactose', 'Inducer', 'Food science', 'Chemistry', 'Crystallization', 'Dairy industry']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.218761

A significant number of these agents are assigned to a specific gender, typically female, thereby reinforcing gender‐related stereotypes. This work employs the stereotype content model (SCM), especially focusing on the two subdimensions sociability and morality, to investigate how the VCA's gender impacts social presence in two studies (Study 1: avatars; Study 2: chatbots). Both studies show an indirect effect of the VCA's gender (female) on social presence through sociability, but not through morality. Contrary to expectations, the indirect effect through sociability is significant for both male and female consumers. The findings indicate that the indirect effect is robust across different product categories (i.e., finance, fashion, holiday trip, and toothbrush) and types of VCAs (i.e., visual and verbal). This research demonstrates how established stereotype theories (i.e., SCM) can serve as a valuable framework for exploring human‐machine communication. Moreover, the results provide a fundamental basis for addressing and reducing the persistence of gender stereotypes, initiating a more extensive discussion about the ethical considerations related to interactions between humans and technology.","['Stereotype (UML)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Content (measure theory)']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.218904

The two agent-based models: the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System (MCRS) and the Stochastic Corrector Model (SCM), are built on principles of systems chemistry, molecular biology, ecology and evolutionary biology. We show that the MCRS is easier to initiate from random RNA communities, while the SCM is more efficient at reducing the genetic assortment load during system growth and preadapted to later evolutionary transitions like chromosome formation, suggesting the former as a stepping stone to the later, protocellular stage. The switching between the two scenarios is shown to be dynamically feasible under a wide range of the parameter space of the merged model, allowing for the emergence of complex cooperative behaviours in metabolically coupled communities of RNA enzymes.","['RNA', 'Protocell', 'Biology', 'Abiogenesis', 'Population', 'Replicator equation', 'Ecology', 'Computational biology', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Gene']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.218990

Foamed concrete, like bricks, can be produced by adding a foaming agent to achieve the desired weight and density, while meeting requirements for strength and durability. However, the search for sustainable construction materials has become imperative , including the use of waste materials to partially replace cement. The incorporation of SCM in the production of cement-based materials, such as foamed concrete, has a significant impact on reducing CO 2 emissions and promoting a sustainable environment. POFA, a secondary product derived from the palm oil industry that is typically left on the ground , poses environmental problems. Due to its good performance and pozzolanic reactions, POFA-based construction materials have great potential as alternatives to ordinary Portland cement. Unlike previous studies, this research evaluates the strength and durability of foamed concrete with variations in foam agent dosages, including finer particles of POFA (100μm) as a partial cement replacement. The study produced a total of 6 batches of foamed concrete, measuring compressive strength, porosity, water absorption, and electrical resistivity. Additionally, the research examined the correlation between compressive strength and porosity, as well as compressive strength and electrical resistivity. This study concludes that an ideal content of 10% POFA with a foaming agent-to-water ratio (fa/w) of 1/60 can achieve the best strength of foamed concrete. Furthermore, a partial cement replacement with 20% POFA could potentially increase the compressive strength to levels similar to those of normal foamed concrete (without POFA).","['Durability', 'Palm oil', 'Materials science', 'Waste management', 'Environmental science', 'Composite material']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.219172

Crumb rubber, sourced from waste tires, is used as a partial replacement for sand in concrete. However, rubber's low density, elasticity, and hydrophobic nature reduce workability and mechanical strength, owing to voids and poor compaction. To address these issues, supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) like silica fume and fly ash, along with polypropylene (PP) fibres, were incorporated in this study. A control mortar mix with a 1:4 cement-to-sand ratio was established, and 10% of the sand was replaced by crumb rubber. SCMs were added at 5% by mass of cement, PP fibres at 0.1% by volume, and a water-reducing agent at 2% by mass. The results demonstrated that the flow-ability was reduced by 50%, reflecting the stiffening effect of rubber, but the compressive strength remained comparable to that of the control specimens due to the beneficial impact of silica fume, fly ash, and fibres. Density decreased by 19% due to the rubber's low density. However, when this mix was applied to concrete, it resulted in shear slump and segregation, as the rubberized mortar was insufficient to cover the coarse aggregates. This suggests that sand replacement in concrete should be done by volume rather than mass to prevent these issues and ensure proper aggregate coverage.","['Slump', 'Mortar', 'Materials science', 'Concrete slump test', 'Shear (geology)', 'Geotechnical engineering', 'Composite material', 'Geology']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.219289

This study delves into the substitution of cement with varying percentages of marble waste (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%). The water-to-binder ratio is consistently set at 0.44 for all mixes. Chemical admixtures such as superplasticizers or viscosity agents are frequently added to the mortar to improve its flow and strength. We conducted mini-slump flow and rheometer tests to assess the fresh mixes' rheological properties, as well as tests to measure the compressive and tensile strength of the mixes. The findings indicate that including marble powder enhances the mechanical properties of self-compacting mortar. A substantial 29% enhancement was achieved for a mixture incorporating 30% marble waste. The most favorable rheological properties, including slump flow, yield stress, and superior mechanical performance in compressive and tensile strength, were observed in the mix containing 30% marble powder waste. Furthermore, the investigation showed that the self-compacting mortar with a yield stress of 0.98 MPa at a 50% MW replacement rate and a viscosity of 1.4 Pa.S can achieve a slump flow of 25–31 cm. These findings illustrate marble waste potential as a valuable addition to self-compacting mortar (SCM) manufacturing, delivering improved performance and structural integrity.

The clinical and subclinical signs and symptoms of the disease serve as the foundation for regular diagnosis. This emphasizes how important it is to identify and quickly find etiological agents at the farm level; many advance diagnostic methods have been developed for this purpose such as infra-red thermography (IRT), proteomic based diagnosis, sequencing, nanotechnology based diagnosis, specific Immunoassays, sensor for mastitis detection, enzymatic biomarker,specific culture, polymerase chain reaction, micro-RNA based diagnosis, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and High resolution-melt analysis.

The framework features a three-layer architecture: the Data Layer identifies confounding variables via Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and screens causal features using Causal Principal Component Analysis (C-PCA); the Model Layer fuses temporal and causal dynamics with a Dynamic Structural Causal Model (DSCM), generating counterfactual budgets via Monte Carlo simulation to quantify intervention effects and balance interdepartmental competition through multi-agent games; the Decision Layer designs reinforcement learning rewards based on counterfactual ROI, embedding strategic constraints and addressing data drift via online A/B testing. The empirical results of the retail industry show that the causal AI model improves budget allocation efficiency by 18.7% compared to traditional ROI models, successfully corrects confounding bias, and captures nonlinear effects.

The materials used in this study were bacillus subtils as the bacteria, regular Portland cement and limestone powder as the binders, fine and coarse aggregates. The mechanical tests carried out were sulphate attack, alkaline attack, splitting tensile strength, compressive strength and flexural strength tests. The samples were subjected to water ponding for three days to induce an initial crack width of no more than 0.3 mm. The samples’ microstructure were characterized using XRF, SEM-EDS, and XRD as well. Based on the data collected, the weight loss, strength, and crack closure indices for each sample were calculated and compared to the control sample. In comparison to the control, it was found that the bacteria’s presence decreased the samples’ crack width as the curing age rose. In addition, the strength, durability, and microstructure of the self-healing concrete were enhanced by the bacteria and limestone powder, particularly when the concrete contained 10% limestone powder. Based on this study, it can be inferred that bacillus subtils can cause concrete to self-heal by forming spores that reduce or completely seal cracks in the concrete.

Al-sareji']","Abstract This study endeavors to tackle the energy requirements of the building sector by employing passive design strategies. However, there exists a dearth of comprehension regarding the energy efficiency performance of foamed alkali-activated materials. To bridge this research gap, the study proposes a solution in the form of a thermally proficient wall material crafted from ceramic tile dust (CTD), class C fly ash (FA), and Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag (GGBS), all of which are industrial by-products. The foamed ternary alkali-activated (FTAA) blocks, developed as a result of this research, exhibited commendable performance in terms of mechanical strength of 18.6 MPa, lower density of 1200 kg/m 3 , porosity of 15.95%, lower specific heat capacity (SHC) of 831 J/(Kg·K), and thermal conductivity (TC) of 0.38 W/(m·K). The thermal efficiency of FTAA blocks curtails the transfer of heat from the external environment to the interior, thereby engendering a more agreeable indoor milieu for occupants. A simulation study utilizing the eQuest tool was executed to evaluate the thermal attributes of the developed blocks and their consequential impact on energy requirements. The findings revealed that in comparison to clay bricks, employing FTAA blocks could yield potential annual energy savings of approximately 4%. Furthermore, notable cost savings of about 4.94% during peak summer months and 5.51% annually were observed. The significance of utilizing these ternary blocks, derived from industrial waste, resides in their affirmative contribution to environmental preservation, augmented indoor thermal comfort, and diminished energy consumption for end users. Consequently, this research makes a meaningful stride towards diminishing operational energy in buildings, harmonizing with sustainability objectives.","['Ternary operation', 'Masonry', 'Energy consumption', 'Consumption (sociology)', 'Alkali metal', 'Computer science']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.220525

These TFCs must be interconnected to share traffic information, enabling infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) communications that are reliable, synchronous and capable of transmitting vehicle data to the Internet. However, I2I communications present a complex optimization challenge. This study addresses this by proposing the design, implementation, and evaluation of an automated management model for I2I service channels based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) integrated with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed models efficiently manage the routing and scheduling of data frames between internet of vehicles (IoV) infrastructure devices through time-sensitive networking (TSN) to ensure real-time synchronous I2I communications. The solution incorporates both a routing model and a scheduling model, evaluated in a simulated shared environment where agents operate within the TSN control plane. Both models are tested for different topologies and background traffic levels. The results demonstrate that the models establish the majority of paths in the scenario, adhering to near-optimal routing and scheduling policies. Recursively, for each individual request to create a service channel, the system establishes online an optimal synchronous path between entities with a limited time budget. In total, 71% of optimal routing paths are established and 97% of optimal schedules are achieved. The approach takes into account the periodic nature of the transmitted data and its robustness through TSN networks, obtaining 99 percent of compliant service requests with flow jitter levels below 100 microseconds for different topologies and different network utility percentages. The proposed solution achieves lower execution delays compared to the iterative ILP approach. Additionally, the solution facilitates the integration of 5G networks for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, which is identified as an area for future exploration.","['Reinforcement learning', 'Computer science', 'Scheduling (production processes)', 'Computer network', 'The Internet', 'Distributed computing']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.220626

By utilizing these industrial by-products, the study seeks to reduce their environmental impact and support the development of sustainable construction materials. Lab-scale testing showed that bauxite pavers showed a decrease in mechanical strength with increasing replacement of ordinary Portland cement. Partial replacement up to 20% still exceeded 30 MPa in compressive strength. Steel slag-based pavers achieved the 30 MPa threshold required for the application with selected mix designs. Pilot-scale production-optimized formulations and standards testing, including freeze-thaw resistance, confirmed the technical viability of these products. Life cycle analysis indicated a 25-27% reduction in CO2 emissions for slag-based tiles compared to traditional concrete tiles. Moreover, using industrial residue reduced mineral resource depletion. This study examined the properties of the resulting alkali-activated binders, their ecological benefits, and their performance compared to conventional materials.

This study aimed to identify repurposable drugs for SCM by integrated multi-omics and network analyses. Methods: We generated a mouse model of SCM induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then obtained comprehensive metabolic and genetic data from SCM mouse hearts using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Using network proximity analysis, we screened for FDA-approved drugs that interact with SCM-associated pathways. Additionally, we tested the cardioprotective effects of two drug candidates in the SCM mouse model and explored their mechanism-of-action in H9c2 cells. Results: Network analysis identified 129 drugs associated with SCM, which were refined to 14 drug candidates based on strong network predictions, proven anti-infective effects, suitability for ICU use, and minimal side effects. Among them, acetaminophen and pyridoxal phosphate significantly improved cardiac function in SCM moues, as demonstrated by the increased ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), and the reduced levels of cardiac injury biomarkers: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I). In vitro assays revealed that acetaminophen inhibited prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation, while pyridoxal phosphate restored amino acid balance, supporting cellular function. These findings suggest that both drugs possess protective effects against SCM. Conclusions: This study provides a robust platform for drug repurposing in SCM, identifying acetaminophen and pyridoxal phosphate as promising candidates for clinical translation, with the potential to improve treatment outcomes in septic patients with cardiac complications.","['Medicine', 'Drug repositioning', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug', 'Septic shock', 'Inotrope', 'Repurposing', 'Sepsis']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.220899

Here, we analyzed sixty S. epidermidis isolates derived from 42 dairy cows across six conventional dairy herds in Denmark. Methods: Phenotypic resistance was measured by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis, and genotypic resistance was examined through whole-genome sequencing and identification of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Correspondence between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was then evaluated by Cohen's kappa statistics. Furthermore, the presence of plasmid replicon genes and the strain diversity among the S. epidermidis isolates was investigated to associate these findings with the observed AMR patterns. Results: Results showed that 30/60 isolates (50.0%) were resistant to penicillin phenotypically, while 35/60 (58.3%) were positive for a corresponding blaZ gene (κ = 0.83, p < 0.01). A fosB gene, encoding fosfomycin resistance, was detected in all 60/60 isolates (100.0%), but fosfomycin resistance was not analyzed phenotypically. Based on MIC analysis, 3/60 isolates (5.0%) were multi-drug resistant, showing resistance towards penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. However, in 11/60 genomes (18.3%), ARGs encoding resistance towards ≥3 antimicrobial classes (e.g., beta-lactams, phosphonic acid, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides, and fusidane) were detected. Eleven different ARGs were detected among the 60 isolates in total. No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were recorded. Results further showed that each herd had one primary sequence type (ST) and resistance profile associated with it, and plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of ARGs was indicated This study underscores the importance of routine resistance surveillance and species-specific diagnoses to improve treatment outcomes and ensure prudent use of antimicrobials.","['Antimicrobial', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis', 'Mastitis', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Danish', 'Subclinical infection', 'Medicine', 'Microbiology', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.221004

The study conducted a concrete mix design for project construction, following significant challenges encountered in attaining the desired strength of 30MPa at a slump of S3 (100-150mm). To address the challenge, a concrete mix design was produced according to EN 206 standard mix design at the laboratory of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI)-Ghana. A chemical admixture consisting of high-range water-lowering sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde (SNF) was used in the design.

The purpose was to explore why Ts24GST has low catalytic activity for the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to hydrophobic substrates such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) compared to the very active Ts26GST but can instead use GSH to isomerize prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2 by reducing its peroxide bond, a reaction described just for s class of cytosolic GSTs. Using our recently deposited structure of Ts24GST in the Protein Data Bank, and a previous model for Ts26GST, we determined by molecular dynamics simulations that the presence of GSH decreased the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds of Ts24GST and increased its radius of gyration, while in Ts26GST the effect was to increase its number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds without significantly changing its radius of gyration. Consistent with this, the experimental thermal stability of Ts26GST increased markedly while that of Ts24GST decreased in the presence of GSH, as determined by intrinsic fluorescence measurements. On the other hand, the binding site for the hydrophobic substrate (H site) of Ts24GST is wider than the H site of Ts26GST, with a 31 % greater solvent-accessible surface area. Resumen. En este trabajo comparamos el efecto del glutatión (GSH) sobre la estabilidad y la dinámica de dos clases diferentes de glutatión transferasas de Taenia solium, la Ts26GST (clase a/m) y la Ts24GST (clase s). El propósito era explorar por qué la Ts24GST tiene una baja actividad catalítica para la conjugación del glutatión (GSH) con sustratos hidrofóbicos como el 1-cloro-2,4-dinitrobenceno (CDNB) en comparación con la muy activa Ts26GST, pero en cambio puede usar GSH para isomerizar la prostaglandina H2 a prostaglandina D2 reduciendo su enlace peróxido, una reacción descrita solo para las GST citosólicas de clase s. Utilizando nuestra estructura recientemente depositada de la Ts24GST en el Protein Data Bank, y un modelo previo para la Ts26GST, determinamos mediante simulaciones de dinámica molecular que la presencia de GSH disminuyó el número de enlaces de hidrógeno intramoleculares de la Ts24GST y aumentó su radio de giro, mientras que en la Ts26GST el efecto fue aumentar su número de enlaces de hidrógeno intramoleculares sin cambiar significativamente su radio de giro. En consonancia con esto, la estabilidad térmica experimental de la Ts26GST aumentó notablemente mientras que para la Ts24GST disminuyó en presencia de GSH, según lo determinado por mediciones de fluorescencia intrínseca. Por otro lado, el sitio de unión para el sustrato hidrofóbico (sitio H) de la Ts24GST es más ancho que el sitio H de la Ts26GST, con una superficie accesible al disolvente un 31 % mayor.","['Taenia solium', 'Glutathione', 'Stability (learning theory)', 'Dynamics (music)', 'Chemistry', 'Psychology']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.221486

The aim was to recycle greenhouse gas carbon dioxide for mitigating emissions, to evaluate the thermal behavior, reactivity, conversion and product composition in terms of structural/chemical characteristics of the fuels, and to provide accurate kinetic parameters useful in the scaling-up of the process. The experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric system, coupled with a mass spectrometer. Both models accurately represented the pyrolysis process by three first-order reactions with deviation values ranging from 1.6% to 2.4%. For the gasification process, one pseudo-component described the process successfully, with deviation values of 2.3-5%. The IPR model provided a superior fit. Activation energy values estimated by the DAEM model were higher than those predicted by the IPR model.","['Kinetic energy', 'Industrial gas', 'Waste management', 'Environmental science', 'Chemistry', 'Process engineering']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.221734

Knowledge of when the sawing window opens and closes would help in reducing the risk of raveling or random cracking due to sawing too early or too late. The aim of this case study was to confirm that initial set can be measured using an ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) approach in the field, and to assess whether there was a relationship between initial set and sawing time for pavement concrete in the field. This case study summarizes 24 construction sites that were visited in Minnesota, Missouri, and Iowa over a two-year period. At each site, initial set was determined using a p-wave propagation technique with a commercial device using samples of concrete collected in front of the paver and tested next to the pavement. Calorimetric data were collected using a commercial semi-adiabatic device on the majority of the sites.","['Ultrasonic sensor', 'Acoustics', 'Materials science', 'Composite material']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.221798

While green practices are essential in developing a more sustainable performance, the effectiveness of those practices may vary from company to company. The purpose of this study is to showcase various green practices adopted and implemented by companies of different sizes to achieve varying levels of environmental performance. Moreover, to ensure higher sustainability, a company could adopt strategies with the adoption of green practices. The present study is quantitative in nature. The study uses a survey of 100 randomly selected small, medium, and large manufacturing Italian companies listed in the “Bureau van Dijik Electronic Publishing” database about their green practices and environmental performance. The results were analyzed using SPSS. It aimed to analyze whether any relationship existed between different green practices and their impact on environmental performance. This research contributes positively to the literature on the association between GSCM practices and environmental performance. It establishes that company size significantly affects the number and types of green practices implemented and how these can be effectively executed to improve environmental outcomes. The study’s findings tested the hypothesis that different-sized companies integrate different Environmental Management practices and GSCM practices. The study revealed that large companies are more likely to implement green practices than small ones. The findings provide practical insights to managers, particularly those in the manufacturing and logistics sectors, about the GSCM practices likely to yield the best performance benefits. The research offers a nuanced approach to implementing various environmental management practices and to adopting GSCM strategies for a sustainable environment.","['Business', 'Supply chain management', 'Supply chain', 'Small and medium-sized enterprises', 'Industrial organization', 'Manufacturing engineering', 'Commerce']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.221855

As research in this area expands, it is essential to synthesize current findings and practices to guide future studies on the feasibility of using seashells as a filler. This study analyzed existing research on using seashells as a partial cement replacement in cementitious composites through a systematic literature review conducted across six scientific databases, yielding 44 studies for data analysis and synthesis. Key findings identified the shell processing methods, established typical ranges for shell powder’s physical–chemical properties and dosage, and quantified the impact on mechanical properties in binary mixtures. The reported effects on mechanical properties varied among studies, potentially due to differences in processing techniques and the origins of the shells. Most improvements in composite properties were observed with 5% to 15% cement replacement in binary mixtures. Overall, incorporating shell powder reduces the carbon emissions of the produced composites. Further detailed investigations into shell processing variables and dosages are recommended to better understand how these factors influence the properties of the composites produced.","['Cementitious', 'Cement', 'Materials science', 'Carbon footprint', 'Filler (materials)', 'Portland cement', 'Composite number', 'Composite material', 'Waste management', 'Environmental science']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.221951

Cognitive control extends the domain of intelligent control, whereby cognitive science theories are applied to guide the design of automatic control systems to make them conform to the human cognition paradigm and behave like a real person, hence improving physical systems performance. Cognitive control has been investigated in several fields, but a comprehensive review covering all these fields has yet to be provided in any paper. This paper first presents a review of cognitive control development and related works. Then, the relationship between cognitive control and cognitive science is analyzed, based on which the definition and framework of cognitive control are summarized from the perspective of automation and control. Cognitive control is then compared with similar concepts, such as cognitive radio and cognitive radar, and similar control methods, such as intelligent control, robust control, and adaptive control. Finally, the main issues, research directions, and development prospects are discussed. We expect that this paper will contribute to the development of cognitive control.","['Cognition', 'Cognitive science', 'Control (management)', 'Psychology', 'Management science', 'Computer science']",agent scm,2025-06-05T11:18:03.222019
