Despite the potential benefits of automating the MRP tasks to meet the demand for expedited and efficient management, the field appears to be lagging behind in harnessing the advancements offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sophisticated programming languages. Consequently, this study aims to address this gap by exploring the applications of Python in simplifying the MRP processes. Methods: This article offers a twofold approach: firstly, it conducts research to uncover the potential applications of the Python code in streamlining the MRP operations, and the practical examples serve as evidence of Python\u2019s efficacy in simplifying the MRP tasks; secondly, this article introduces a conceptual framework that showcases the Python ecosystem, highlighting libraries and structures that enable efficient data manipulation, analysis, and optimization techniques. Results: This study presents a versatile framework that integrates a variety of Python tools, including but not limited to Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, to streamline and actualize an 8-step MRP process. Additionally, it offers preliminary insights into the integration of the Python-based MRP solution (MRP.py) with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Conclusions: While the article focuses on demonstrating the practicality of Python in MRP, future endeavors will entail empirically integrating MRP.py with the ERP systems in small- and medium-sized companies. This integration will establish real-time data synchronization between the Python and ERP systems, leading to accurate MRP calculations and enhanced decision-making processes.","source_file":"1.2.2.1 LR - The Specialist Shortage and its Impact.csv","extracted_keywords":["mrp","python","management","article","erp","systems","planning","potential","tasks","efficient"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA\u2019s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption.","source_file":"1.2.2.1 LR - The Specialist Shortage and its Impact.csv","extracted_keywords":["rpa","adoption","potential","barriers","process","beef","model","supply","chain","allows"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The computational approach based on FEAHP automates supplier selection by determining a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. First, the criteria and sub-criteria specific to the selection problem were identified by the experts taking the relevant literature as a starting point. Next, the experts performed a pair-wise comparison of the predefined requirements using a linguistic scale. This evaluation was then quantified by calculating the priority weights of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The best decision alternative is the one with the highest final score. Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the results of the proposed model. The FEAHP computer approach automated the supplier selection process in a rational, flexible, and agile way, as perceived by the focal company.

The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives\u2019 trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their \u201cnetwork trust\u201d) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives\u2019 professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives\u2019 trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives\u2019 knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes.

Methods: Thus, this research aimed to understand the main challenges faced by professionals in the supply chain area in the Amazon region through the development of a survey with professionals in the area. This study conducted a structured questionnaire containing 10 challenges related to SCM during the pandemic period to generate a ranking of these challenges using data analysis using means and comparative ordering using the TOPSIS Multicriteria Technique. Results: It was observed that the most relevant challenges for companies in this region were, respectively, distribution, economic problems, and interruptions in supply and demand. These obstacles promote debates with the literature and foster the expansion of knowledge about the insertion of resilience elements in supply chains in the Amazon. Conclusions: From a theoretical point of view and because it is exploratory research, the results serve as a basis for researchers in the area who aim to understand and expand the debates on this topic through future research. From a practical point of view, the results can help supply chain managers in the Amazon region who work directly in its maintenance and aim to maintain its resilience, since they already have the main challenges for the proper functioning of supply chains identified and ranked.

From 2015, in SECA, ship owners are not allowed to use fuel with more than 0.1% Sulphur content. One of the major concerns for the SECA regulation is that maritime stakeholders have had to take into consideration the costs as well as the tolerable risks of their compliance investment options. Besides that, low freight rates have increased the competition and had caused financial pressure on ship owners so that lower capital reserves and low credibility levels limit the manoeuvring space for investment activities.\nThe indications from BSR after 2015 showed that the low fuel price has eased the economic effects of the SECA regulation and as a result, most ship owners have delayed their investment decisions. Even though the postponement of emission abatement techniques seems to have reduced the compliance expenses for SECA, they, however, did not improve the position of shipowners relative to their competitors. Consequently, new policy instruments to stimulate innovation, to raise competitiveness and to comply with the new environmental regulations are needed. It would have been easier to hedge fuel price volatility and offer maritime logistics services for a lower price, but to be able to ensure sustainable results in long-term, maritime stakeholders must be ready to device astute strategies that can propel them to unparalleled advantage.\nThis research first appraised the investment risks and payback period associated with the scrubber using different capital budgeting methods. It further illustrated the Maritime Energy Contracting (MEC) model as a market mechanism for the delivery of a cost-effective emission reduction using the scrubber technology as well as an instrument to realise a competitive advantage for ship operators.

Therefore, efficient models incorporating the unique characteristics of such chains are essential for making optimal supply chain decisions and achieving economically and environmentally sustainable agro-food supply chains that contribute to global food security. Methods: This article presents a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programing model that integrates agricultural-related strategic decisions into the tactical design of an agro-food supply chain. The model considers transportation, inventory, processing, demand fulfilment, and waste disposal decisions. It also accounts for seasonality and perishability, ensuring a comprehensive approach to sustainability. The model aims to maximize the total generated profits across the supply chain while simultaneously minimizing CO2 emissions as a measure of environmental impact. Results: By implementing the model on a sugar beet supply chain in the Netherlands, strategic crop rotation farm schedules for the crop rotation cycle and the optimum supply network decisions are obtained. Furthermore, different objectives are analyzed and the Pareto-efficient frontier is investigated to analyze the underlying trade-offs. Additionally, the model serves as a decision support tool for managers facilitating informed investment decisions in technologies that prolong product shelf life while maintaining profitability.

In spite of extensive research examining how IT can be employed in various activities of supply chain management, the majority of studies are limited in identifying enablers and inhibitors of adoption. Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance.

Maintenance and repair services, strongly associated with the reverse movement of equipment, are among the most demanding reverse supply chain operations. Equipment is scattered in various locations, and multiple suppliers are involved in its maintenance, making it challenging to manage the related reverse supply chain operations. Effective maintenance is essential for businesses-owners of the equipment, as reducing costs while improving service quality helps them gain a competitive advantage. Methods: To enhance reverse supply chain operations related to equipment maintenance, this paper presents the operational framework, the methodological approach, and the architecture for developing a system that covers the needs for predictive maintenance in the service supply chain. It is based on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as the Internet of things, machine learning, and cloud computing. Results: As a result of the successful implementation of the system, effective equipment maintenance and service supply chain management is achieved supporting the reverse supply chain.

In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers\u2019 influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 decisions. When taking into account retailers\u2019 buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer\u2019s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

We used a qualitative methodology through multiple case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four companies. The semi-structured script contains questions about supply chain disruptions, vulnerabilities and resilience. The main results show that the companies in Guinea-Bissau, due to their dependence on the outside world and the absence of formal, larger and more diversified supply chains, suffered serious consequences with the disruption imposed by the pandemic. It was also concluded that the more resilient the supply chain, the fewer the impacts of crisis events and that the resilience of companies at this level depends on their obtaining competitive advantages over their competitors. The main practical implications of this study are the need to formalize the supply chain, diversify the supply of services and products of companies dependent on the exterior, adopt metrics that allow for the early detection of situations of supply chain disruption, effectively manage stocks and promote proactive crisis resolution strategies.

There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention.

The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain.

This enables us to model and evaluate simultaneous considerations of supplier disruption, customs duty, and TPP in redesigning a global supply chain network. This network is modeled and formulated using integer programming, disruption scenarios, and a sensitivity analysis for customs duty. Results: Regarding the impact of disruptions on suppliers, two patterns emerge in the reconfigured network: direct changes due to supplier disruptions and indirect changes due to factory relocation. The sensitivity analysis for customs duty shows that the TPP has a positive impact on cost maintained, even in the presence of disruptions.

Therefore, efficient models incorporating the unique characteristics of such chains are essential for making optimal supply chain decisions and achieving economically and environmentally sustainable agro-food supply chains that contribute to global food security. Methods: This article presents a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programing model that integrates agricultural-related strategic decisions into the tactical design of an agro-food supply chain. The model considers transportation, inventory, processing, demand fulfilment, and waste disposal decisions. It also accounts for seasonality and perishability, ensuring a comprehensive approach to sustainability. The model aims to maximize the total generated profits across the supply chain while simultaneously minimizing CO2 emissions as a measure of environmental impact. Results: By implementing the model on a sugar beet supply chain in the Netherlands, strategic crop rotation farm schedules for the crop rotation cycle and the optimum supply network decisions are obtained. Furthermore, different objectives are analyzed and the Pareto-efficient frontier is investigated to analyze the underlying trade-offs. Additionally, the model serves as a decision support tool for managers facilitating informed investment decisions in technologies that prolong product shelf life while maintaining profitability.

We used a qualitative methodology through multiple case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four companies. The semi-structured script contains questions about supply chain disruptions, vulnerabilities and resilience. The main results show that the companies in Guinea-Bissau, due to their dependence on the outside world and the absence of formal, larger and more diversified supply chains, suffered serious consequences with the disruption imposed by the pandemic. It was also concluded that the more resilient the supply chain, the fewer the impacts of crisis events and that the resilience of companies at this level depends on their obtaining competitive advantages over their competitors. The main practical implications of this study are the need to formalize the supply chain, diversify the supply of services and products of companies dependent on the exterior, adopt metrics that allow for the early detection of situations of supply chain disruption, effectively manage stocks and promote proactive crisis resolution strategies.

Costs, GHG emissions, and carbon tax prices differ in each country due to economic conditions, energy mixes, and government policies. Additionally, multiple countries have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices.

This added flexibility, however, requires coordination between vehicles and customers that adds complexity to routing operations. This paper develops scalable algorithms to optimize these operations. First, we solve the one-stop subproblem in the [Formula: see text] space and the [Formula: see text] space by leveraging the geometric structure of operations. Second, to solve a multistop problem, we embed the single-stop optimization into a tailored coordinate descent scheme, which we prove converges to a global optimum. Third, we develop a new algorithm for dial-a-ride problems based on a subpath-based time\u2013space network optimization combining set partitioning and time\u2013space principles. Finally, we propose an online routing algorithm to support real-world ride-sharing operations with vehicle\u2013customer coordination. Computational results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, yielding far superior solutions in shorter computational times and can support real-time operations in very large-scale systems. From a practical standpoint, most of the benefits of vehicle\u2013customer coordination stem from comprehensively reoptimizing \u201cupstream\u201d operations as opposed to merely adjusting \u201cdownstream\u201d stopping locations.

This is especially relevant in view of growing boundarylessness of careers that impacts the logistics sector with its high ratio of lateral entrants. We enrich the analysis of training and education decision-making processes with a third view beyond the common ex ante and ex post perspectives that has not been employed yet in this context. Our insights, modeled as a new prae ante view, can help prevent myopia in educational choice on an individual level and the resulting economic inefficiencies. This translates into more fitting provisions by individuals earlier, and into improved targeting of prospective employees in logistics. The purpose of this study is to provide an agent-based description grounded in behavioral economics, supported by an explorative empirical survey using extensive semi-structured expert-interviews with six participants concerning four to six career transitions each, conducted with employees in logistics professions. Main conclusions include that participants who were asked openly about influential factors for education and career decisions were oblivious of some factors described as highly predictive of educational and career success in literature, not acknowledging social and cultural capital, habitus, and chance, but also consistently ascribing success to a \"milestone-mindset\" to be described here as well.Logistics 2018, 2, 24 2 of 16 specific logistics education and training is beyond dispute [5][6][7], the issue of time-inconsistent choices in that regard has rarely been addressed, which appears especially striking given the high occurrence of track changes leading employees into logistics as lateral entrants [8][9][10]. Time inconsistency is a well-established topic in behavioral economics [11][12][13][14], while basic or continuing education and training are discussed in research in many contexts including our instance regarding the context of time-inconsistent educational choice in logistics.In our approach, all levels of education and training in logistics (vocational, academic, and continuing) are involved [15,16]. In this contribution, three perspectives are discerned, two of which are commonplace in economic theory. Usually, economic theory describes a decision perspective from an ex ante and ex post view. We deem this an unjustified limitation and propose an extended framework including a new \"prae ante\" view, for which this paper provides qualitative insights into the influential factors for this additional analytical perspective. Educational and career choices can be seen as investments in one's own human capital and are often analyzed both strategically (ex ante) and evaluated (ex post).

Based on an Analytical Hierarchy Process conducted with 17 SCM practitioners, the paper assesses the relative impact of sources of SCV, and further contextualizes them according to factors such as product lead time and production strategy, providing more fine-grained insights for SC managers seeking to manage SCV. Subsequently, the paper applies the Nominal Group Technique with the same group of practitioners in order to identify and condense strategies for dealing with the most impactful sources of SCV (intra-organizational misalignment, inaccurate forecasting, long lead times, erratic behavior of decision makers in the supply chain, erratic behavior of customers, and high level of competition), leading to a set of 44 SCV-management strategies.","source_file":"1.2.2.1 LR - The Specialist Shortage and its Impact.csv","extracted_keywords":["scv","supply","chain","sources","research","areas","manage","relative","impact","practitioners"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Various strategies and guidelines highlight the concept as a key goal. However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance.

In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with educators in England to gain their perspectives on the potential use of humanoid robots with autistic pupils, eliciting ideas, and specific examples of potential use. Understanding educator views is essential, because they are key decision-makers for the adoption of robots and would directly facilitate future use with pupils. Educators were provided with several example images (e.g., NAO, KASPAR, Milo), but did not directly interact with robots or receive information on current technical capabilities. The goal was for educators to respond to the general concept of humanoid robots as an educational tool, rather than to focus on the existing uses or behaviour of a particular robot. Thirty-one autism education staff participated, representing a range of special education settings and age groups as well as multiple professional roles (e.g., teachers, teaching assistants, speech, and language therapists). Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts identified four themes: Engagingness of robots, Predictability and consistency, Roles of robots in autism education, and Need for children to interact with people, not robots. Although almost all interviewees were receptive toward using humanoid robots in the classroom, they were not uncritically approving. Rather, they perceived future robot use as likely posing a series of complex cost-benefit trade-offs over time. For example, they felt that a highly motivating, predictable social robot might increase children's readiness to learn in the classroom, but it could also prevent children from engaging fully with other people or activities. Educator views also assumed that skills learned with a robot would generalise, and that robots' predictability is beneficial for autistic children-claims that need further supporting evidence. These interview results offer many points of guidance to the HRI research community about how humanoid robots could meet the specific needs of autistic learners, as well as identifying issues that will need to be resolved for robots to be both acceptable and successfully deployed in special education contexts.","source_file":"1.2.2.1 LR - The Specialist Shortage and its Impact.csv","extracted_keywords":["robots","education","use","humanoid","robot","potential","autism","educators","autistic","need"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Humanoid Robots** (combines \"humanoid\" and \"robots\" for better search precision)\n2. **Autism Education** (clearer and more specific than separate terms)\n3. **Special Education** (captures the specific educational context)\n4. **Educator Perceptions** (focuses on the key data source)\n5. **Social Robots** (highlights the social interaction aspect)\n6. **Technology Acceptance** (broader term encompassing cost-benefit trade-offs)"]}

At least half of all children worldwide experience violence every year; globally, the total number of children between the ages of 2 and 17 years who have experienced violence in any given year is one billion.

This potential is particularly marked in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), although whether it could translate into effective solutions at scale remains unclear. We discuss possible entry points for Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and mHealth approaches to violence prevention, linking these to the World Health Organization's seven INSPIRE strategies. However, such work should be approached with caution. We highlight clear directions for future work in technology-based and technology-enabled violence prevention. We argue that there is a need for good agent-based models at the level of entire cities where and when violence can occur, where local response systems are. Yet, there is a need to develop common, reliable, and valid population-and individual\/family-level data on predictors of violence. These indicators could be integrated into routine health or other information systems and become the basis of Al algorithms for violence prevention and response systems. Further, data on individual help-seeking behavior, risk factors for child maltreatment, and other information which could help us to identify the parameters required to understand what happens to cause, and in response to violence, are needed. To respond to ethical issues engendered by these kinds of interventions, there must be concerted, meaningful efforts to develop participatory and user-led work in the AI space, to ensure that the privacy and profiling concerns outlined above are addressed explicitly going forward.

Despite the potential benefits of automating the MRP tasks to meet the demand for expedited and efficient management, the field appears to be lagging behind in harnessing the advancements offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sophisticated programming languages. Consequently, this study aims to address this gap by exploring the applications of Python in simplifying the MRP processes. Methods: This article offers a twofold approach: firstly, it conducts research to uncover the potential applications of the Python code in streamlining the MRP operations, and the practical examples serve as evidence of Python\u2019s efficacy in simplifying the MRP tasks; secondly, this article introduces a conceptual framework that showcases the Python ecosystem, highlighting libraries and structures that enable efficient data manipulation, analysis, and optimization techniques. Results: This study presents a versatile framework that integrates a variety of Python tools, including but not limited to Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, to streamline and actualize an 8-step MRP process.

Most companies are unwilling to share data or do not have time for annotation. In addition, most available facility management data are text data. Thus, there is a need for an unsupervised predictive maintenance algorithm that is capable of handling textual data. Methodology: This paper proposes applying association rule mining on maintenance requests to identify upcoming needs in facility management. By coupling temporal association rule mining with the concept of semantic similarity derived from large language models, the proposed methodology can discover meaningful knowledge in the form of rules suitable for decision-making. Results: Relying on the large German language models works best for the presented case study. Introducing a temporal lift filter allows for reducing the created rules to the most important ones. Conclusions: Only a few maintenance requests are sufficient to mine association rules that show links between different infrastructural failures.

In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM\u2019s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking.

Moreover, regularization regression models that shrink the model\u2019s parameters allow for the inclusion of a lot of relevant information but do not intrinsically handle the dynamics of the demand. These problems have not been addressed by previous studies. Nevertheless, multiple simultaneous effects interacting are common in retailing. To be successful, any approach needs to be automatic, robust and efficiently scaleable. In this study, we design novel approaches to forecast retailer product sales taking into account the main drivers which affect SKU demand at store level. To address the variable selection challenge, the use of dimensionality reduction via principal components analysis (PCA) and shrinkage estimators was investigated. The empirical results, using a case study of supermarket sales in Portugal, show that both PCA and shrinkage are useful and result in gains in forecast accuracy in the order of 10% over benchmarks while offering insights on the impact of promotions. Focusing on the promotional periods, PCA-based models perform strongly, while shrinkage estimators over-shrink. For the non-promotional periods, shrinkage estimators significantly outperform the alternatives.","source_file":"1.2.2.2 LR - AI Applications in SCM Decision Support.csv","extracted_keywords":["shrinkage","sales","demand","models","estimators","product","store","sku","level","efficiently"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Sales Forecasting:** This is a broad term encompassing the core topic of the paper.\n2. **Dimensionality Reduction:**  Highlights a key methodological approach used.\n3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Specifies a crucial technique within dimensionality reduction.\n4. **Shrinkage Estimation:**  Points to another major methodological contribution.\n5. **Retail Sales:**  Adds specificity to the application domain.\n6. **Time Series Forecasting:** Captures the temporal aspect of sales data and modelling."]}

There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information.

For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT\u2019s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs\u2019 exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system.","source_file":"1.2.2.2 LR - AI Applications in SCM Decision Support.csv","extracted_keywords":["health","aihts","ai","hta","exceptional","healthcare","system","challenges","impacts","care"],"revised_keywords":["1.

However, guaranteeing the security and integrity of hydrogen-related data has become a significant challenge. This paper proposes a pioneering approach to ensure secure hydrogen data analysis by integrating blockchain technology, enhancing trust, transparency, and privacy in handling hydrogen-related information. Combining blockchain with intelligent power management systems makes the efficient utilization of hydrogen resources feasible. Using smart contracts and distributed ledger technology facilitates secure data analysis (SDA), real-time monitoring, prediction, and optimization of hydrogen-based power systems. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach are demonstrated through comprehensive case studies and simulations. Notably, our prediction models, including ABiLSTM, ALSTM, and ARNN, consistently delivered high accuracy with MAE values of approximately 0.154, 0.151, and 0.151, respectively, enhancing the security and efficiency of hydrogen consumption forecasts.

But the circumstances under which algorithm aversion or algorithm appreciation are more likely to occur with respect to LLMs have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how texts with moral or technological topics, allegedly written either by a human author or by ChatGPT, are perceived.MethodsIn a randomized controlled experiment, n = 164 participants read six texts, three of which had a moral and three a technological topic (predictor text topic). The alleged author of each text was randomly either labeled \u201cChatGPT\u201d or \u201chuman author\u201d (predictor authorship). We captured three dependent variables: assessment of author competence, assessment of content quality, and participants' intention to submit the text in a hypothetical university course (sharing intention). We hypothesized interaction effects, that is, we expected ChatGPT to score lower than alleged human authors for moral topics and higher than alleged human authors for technological topics and vice versa.ResultsWe only found a small interaction effect for perceived author competence, p = 0.004, d = 0.40, but not for the other dependent variables. However, ChatGPT was consistently devalued compared to alleged human authors across all dependent variables: there were main effects of authorship for assessment of the author competence, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.95; for assessment of content quality, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.39; as well as for sharing intention, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.57.

We also provide a new method for determining optimal sparse alternatives, which trade off size and accuracy. The experiments in this paper demonstrate that the optimal decision sets computed by the SAT-based approach are comparable with the best heuristic methods, but much more succinct, and thus, more explainable.

A critical step in the treatment and management of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline, with computed tomography (CT) imaging being a particularly effective method for determining the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT images. More specifically, machine-driven design exploration was leveraged to determine a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we build a customized network design tailored for predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) based on a patient\u2019s CT scan, initial spirometry measurement, and clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to study the decision-making behavior of Fibrosis-Net as to verify that predictions are based on relevant visual indicators in CT images. Experiments using a patient cohort from the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge showed that the proposed Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the challenge. Furthermore, explainability-driven performance validation demonstrated that the proposed Fibrosis-Net exhibits correct decision-making behavior by leveraging clinically-relevant visual indicators in CT images when making predictions on pulmonary fibrosis progress. Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge, and has been shown to exhibit correct decision-making behavior when making predictions. Fibrosis-Net is available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the OpenMedAI initiative.

There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA\u2019s accuracy.

This requires a shift in perspective from technology-driven questions to a human-centered research and design agenda putting people and evolving teams in the center of attention. A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.MethodsThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view.

The aim of this study is to distinguish prevalent criteria of human-centricity for AI applications in the scientific discourse and to relate them to the work contexts for which they are specifically intended. This leads to configurations of actor-structure engagements that foster human-centricity in the workplace.Theoretical foundationThe study applies configurational theory to sociotechnical systems\u2019 analysis of work settings. The assumption is that different approaches to promote human-centricity coexist, depending on the stakeholders responsible for their application.MethodThe exploration of criteria indicating human-centricity and their synthesis into configurations is based on a cross-disciplinary literature review following a systematic search strategy and a deductive-inductive qualitative content analysis of 101 research articles.ResultsThe article outlines eight criteria of human-centricity, two of which face challenges of human-centered technology development (trustworthiness and explainability), three challenges of human-centered employee development (prevention of job loss, health, and human agency and augmentation), and three challenges of human-centered organizational development (compensation of systems\u2019 weaknesses, integration of user-domain knowledge, accountability, and safety culture). The configurational theory allows contextualization of these criteria from a higher-order perspective and leads to seven configurations of actor-structure engagements in terms of engagement for (1) data and technostructure, (2) operational process optimization, (3) operators\u2019 employment, (4) employees\u2019 wellbeing, (5) proficiency, (6) accountability, and (7) interactive cross-domain design.

Trustworthiness does not build its own configuration but is proposed to be a necessary condition in all seven configurations.DiscussionThe article contextualizes the overall debate on human-centricity and allows us to specify stakeholder-related engagements and how these complement each other.

However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance.

Overall, there appears to be no clear relationship between AI exposure and employment growth. However, in occupations where computer use is high, greater exposure to AI is linked to higher employment growth. The paper also finds suggestive evidence of a negative relationship between AI exposure and growth in average hours worked among occupations where computer use is low. One possible explanation is that partial automation by AI increases productivity directly as well as by shifting the task composition of occupations toward higher value-added tasks. This increase in labor productivity and output counteracts the direct displacement effect of automation through AI for workers with good digital skills, who may find it easier to use AI effectively and shift to non-automatable, higher-value added tasks within their occupations. The opposite could be true for workers with poor digital skills, who may not be able to interact efficiently with AI and thus reap all potential benefits of the technology1.","source_file":"1.2.2.3 LR - Human-AI Collaboration in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["ai","occupations","employment","exposure","growth","use","impact","labor","displacement","paper"],"revised_keywords":["1.

This requires a shift in perspective from technology-driven questions to a human-centered research and design agenda putting people and evolving teams in the center of attention. A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.MethodsThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view. In addition, antecedents and outcomes examined in the literature are extracted to guide future research in this field.ResultsThrough network analysis, five clusters with different research focuses on HAIT were identified. These clusters revolve around (1) human and (2) task-dependent variables, (3) AI explainability, (4) AI-driven robotic systems, and (5) the effects of AI performance on human perception.

This is especially true for patients that need support to stay as independent as possible. To be human-aware, an AI should be able to anticipate the intentions of the individual humans it interacts with, in order to understand the difficulties and limitations they are facing and to adapt accordingly. While data-driven AI approaches have recently gained a lot of attention, more research is needed on assistive AI systems that can develop models of their partners' goals to offer proactive support without needing a lot of training trials for new problems. We propose an integrated AI system that can anticipate actions of individual humans to contribute to the foundations of trustworthy human-robot interaction. We test this in Tangram, which is an exemplary sequential problem solving task that requires dynamic decision making. In this task the sequences of steps to the goal might be variable and not known by the system. These are aspects that are also recognized as real world challenges for robotic systems. A hybrid approach based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R is presented that is not purely data-driven but includes cognitive principles, meaning heuristics that guide human decisions. Core of this Cognitive Tangram Solver (CTS) framework is an ACT-R cognitive model that simulates human problem solving behavior in action, recognizes possible dead ends and identifies ways forward. Based on this model, the CTS anticipates and adapts its predictions about the next action to take in any given situation. We executed an empirical study and collected data from 40 participants. The predictions made by CTS were evaluated with the participants' behavior, including comparative statistics as well as prediction accuracy. The model's anticipations compared to the human test data provide support for justifying further steps built upon our conceptual approach.","source_file":"1.2.2.3 LR - Human-AI Collaboration in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["ai","cognitive","systems","humans","problem","solving","support","human","cts","model"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Human-Aware AI:** Captures the core focus of the research on AI systems that understand and anticipate human behavior.\n2. **Sequential Problem Solving:**  Highlights the specific type of problem addressed in the research (Tangram puzzle).\n3. **Action Anticipation:**  Focuses on the key functionality of the AI system \u2013 predicting human actions.\n4. **Hybrid Cognitive Architecture:**  Describes the novel approach used","combining data-driven and cognitive modeling.\n5. **ACT-R Model:** Specifies the cognitive architecture utilized in the system.\n6. **Human-Robot Interaction:**  Broader context and application area of the research."]}

This is especially true for patients that need support to stay as independent as possible. To be human-aware, an AI should be able to anticipate the intentions of the individual humans it interacts with, in order to understand the difficulties and limitations they are facing and to adapt accordingly. While data-driven AI approaches have recently gained a lot of attention, more research is needed on assistive AI systems that can develop models of their partners' goals to offer proactive support without needing a lot of training trials for new problems. We propose an integrated AI system that can anticipate actions of individual humans to contribute to the foundations of trustworthy human-robot interaction. We test this in Tangram, which is an exemplary sequential problem solving task that requires dynamic decision making. In this task the sequences of steps to the goal might be variable and not known by the system. These are aspects that are also recognized as real world challenges for robotic systems. A hybrid approach based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R is presented that is not purely data-driven but includes cognitive principles, meaning heuristics that guide human decisions. Core of this Cognitive Tangram Solver (CTS) framework is an ACT-R cognitive model that simulates human problem solving behavior in action, recognizes possible dead ends and identifies ways forward. Based on this model, the CTS anticipates and adapts its predictions about the next action to take in any given situation. We executed an empirical study and collected data from 40 participants. The predictions made by CTS were evaluated with the participants' behavior, including comparative statistics as well as prediction accuracy. The model's anticipations compared to the human test data provide support for justifying further steps built upon our conceptual approach.","source_file":"1.2.2.3 LR - Human-AI Collaboration in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["ai","cognitive","systems","humans","problem","solving","support","human","cts","model"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: This captures the central theme of the research.\n2. **Action Anticipation**: This highlights the core functionality of the proposed system.\n3. **Cognitive Modeling**: This reflects the use of ACT-R and the focus on simulating human cognition.\n4. **Sequential Problem Solving**: This specifies the type of problem addressed in the study.\n5. **Assistive AI**: This emphasizes the application domain and intended purpose.\n6. **Hybrid AI**: This distinguishes the approach from purely data-driven methods."]}

A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.MethodsThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view.

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption.

Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI\/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and\/or valuation of derivatives.

This article aims to examine the challenges of defining, identifying and mitigating discriminatory bias in AI systems from two perspectives: (1) to conduct an ethical and normative review of European Commission documents from the last 8\u2009years (from GDPR to AI Act regulation); and (2) to expose recommendations for key stakeholders, including designers, end-users and public authorities, to minimize\/mitigate this risk. The document review was carried out on 21 EU regulatory and ethical guidelines in the field of AI, from which 152 measures were extracted, differentiated between design, governance and organizational measures. It has also been observed that there is no clear conceptual framework on the issue at the European level, showing a clear problem in providing definitions of algorithmic bias and discrimination, but not in assessing their potential negative impact on individuals. Secondly, these gaps may affect the concreteness and detail of the possible mitigation\/minimization measures proposed and, subsequently, their application in different contexts.

Global expansions and knowledge transfer in supply chain networks bring efficiency and effectiveness to companies. However, the probability of supply chain complexity has also been seen increasing. The barriers to sustainable supply chain networks need to be tackled in an effective manner as they impact business operations. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate and reduce the supply chain complexities, as it will facilitate the process of knowledge transfer and increase the implementation of sustainable practises in supply chain networks. In the previous research, four supply chain complexity drivers were identified. Previous research identified four supply chain complexity drivers by conducting a systematic review. This study investigates which of the four complexity drivers impacts knowledge transfer in the context of the food supply chain sector. Methods: In this research, knowledge transfer is therefore examined from the perspective of sustainable food supply chains. Thirty exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted in this study and analysed using Nvivo (v12) software. This study utilised thematic analysis techniques for the evaluation of the interviews to gather results. Results: The results illustrated six main factors classified under broad categories: integration of Knowledge Transfer, incorporation of technological advancements in supply chain networks, supply chain complexity solutions, supply chain complexity drivers, sustainable supply chain networks, and capability to reduce supply chain complexity. The findings of this study highlight that process complexity significantly influences the process of knowledge transfer in food supply chain networks. The research findings contribute to both academic and practical domains. This study contributes to the aggregation of supply chain complexity and its impact on Knowledge Transfer. Additionally, the findings support supply chain networks, which strive to achieve efficient Knowledge Transfer to attain sustainable value in business operations.

We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly.

Yet, there is no common taxonomy neither within one field (such as data science) nor between different fields (law and data science). In certain areas like healthcare, the requirements of transparency are crucial since the decisions directly affect people's lives.

At least half of all children worldwide experience violence every year; globally, the total number of children between the ages of 2 and 17 years who have experienced violence in any given year is one billion. Based on a review of the literature, we argue that there is substantial potential for AI (and associated machine learning and big data), and mHealth approaches to be utilized to prevent and address violence at a large scale. This potential is particularly marked in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), although whether it could translate into effective solutions at scale remains unclear. We discuss possible entry points for Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and mHealth approaches to violence prevention, linking these to the World Health Organization's seven INSPIRE strategies. However, such work should be approached with caution. We highlight clear directions for future work in technology-based and technology-enabled violence prevention. We argue that there is a need for good agent-based models at the level of entire cities where and when violence can occur, where local response systems are. Yet, there is a need to develop common, reliable, and valid population-and individual\/family-level data on predictors of violence. These indicators could be integrated into routine health or other information systems and become the basis of Al algorithms for violence prevention and response systems.

However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance.

However, if an agent guides the human behavior explicitly, the human may feel that they have lost autonomy and are being controlled by the agent. We therefore investigated implicit guidance offered by means of an agent\u2019s behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent acts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a collaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan.

To systematically address risks to autonomy, we need to confront the complexity of the concept itself and adapt governance solutions accordingly.It is hard to overstate the important role autonomy plays for our moral and political institutions. A cornerstone of human dignity and a prerequisite of liberal democracy, autonomy is often considered a fundamental human value [1-4]. Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) development opens up new opportunities for supporting and fostering autonomy, but it simultaneously poses significant risks. Recent incidents of AI-facilitated deception, manipulation, or coercion suggest that AI technologies could seriously interfere with human autonomy on a large scale. Cambridge Analytica's attempt to manipulate voters is just one example [5]. Facebook's \"emotional contagion\" experiment, in which users were swayed towards adopting certain emotional states, yet another one [6].

For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT\u2019s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs\u2019 exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system.","source_file":"1.2.2.3 LR - Human-AI Collaboration in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["health","aihts","ai","hta","exceptional","healthcare","system","challenges","impacts","care"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Methods: The methodology used for this meta-study is based on Kitchenham and Charters guidelines, resulting in a selection of 44 literature reviews published between 2000 and 2021. Results: As a summary of the results, the main areas of AI in SCM were algorithms, followed by the Internet of Things (IoT). The main barriers to AI adoption in SCM are change management, existing technical limitations, and the acceptance of humans for these techniques. The main drivers of AI in SCM are saving costs and increasing efficiency in combination with reducing time and resources. The main social factor is human\u2013robot collaboration. As a result, there will be a decreased amount of labour needed in the future, impacting many existing jobs, especially in low-income areas. Conclusions: Therefore, it is essential for organisations that implement new technology to start as early as possible to inform the organisation about the changes and help them successfully implement them. It is also important to mention that constant learning and improvement of the employees are critical for adopting and successfully using new AI tools.

Even standard OOM approaches, such as unified modelling language (UML) methods, exhibit inherent weaknesses due to their lack of formalized innovation with business objects and the dynamic control-flows of complex business processes. In addition to these issues, both BPM and OOM approaches have been augmented with an array of complex software tools and techniques which have confused businesses. There is a lack of a common generalized framework that integrates the well-formalised control-flow based BPM approach and the dataflow based OOM approach that is suitable for today\u2019s enterprise systems in order to support organisations to achieve successful business process improvements. This paper takes a modest step to fill this gap. We propose a framework using a structured six-step business process modelling (BPM) guideline combined with a business object-oriented methodology (BOOM) in a unique and practical way that could be adopted for improving an organisation\u2019s process efficiency and business performance in contemporary enterprise systems. Our proposed business object-oriented process modelling (BOOPM) framework is applied to a business case study in order to demonstrate the practical implementation and process efficiency improvements that can be achieved in enterprise systems using such a structured and integrated approach.","source_file":"1.2.2.3 LR - Human-AI Collaboration in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["business","process","modelling","bpm","approaches","systems","oom","efficiency","order","today"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The aim of this study is to distinguish prevalent criteria of human-centricity for AI applications in the scientific discourse and to relate them to the work contexts for which they are specifically intended. This leads to configurations of actor-structure engagements that foster human-centricity in the workplace.Theoretical foundationThe study applies configurational theory to sociotechnical systems\u2019 analysis of work settings. The assumption is that different approaches to promote human-centricity coexist, depending on the stakeholders responsible for their application.MethodThe exploration of criteria indicating human-centricity and their synthesis into configurations is based on a cross-disciplinary literature review following a systematic search strategy and a deductive-inductive qualitative content analysis of 101 research articles.ResultsThe article outlines eight criteria of human-centricity, two of which face challenges of human-centered technology development (trustworthiness and explainability), three challenges of human-centered employee development (prevention of job loss, health, and human agency and augmentation), and three challenges of human-centered organizational development (compensation of systems\u2019 weaknesses, integration of user-domain knowledge, accountability, and safety culture). The configurational theory allows contextualization of these criteria from a higher-order perspective and leads to seven configurations of actor-structure engagements in terms of engagement for (1) data and technostructure, (2) operational process optimization, (3) operators\u2019 employment, (4) employees\u2019 wellbeing, (5) proficiency, (6) accountability, and (7) interactive cross-domain design. Each has one criterion of human-centricity in the foreground. Trustworthiness does not build its own configuration but is proposed to be a necessary condition in all seven configurations.DiscussionThe article contextualizes the overall debate on human-centricity and allows us to specify stakeholder-related engagements and how these complement each other. This is of high value for practitioners bringing human-centricity to the workplace and allows them to compare which criteria are considered in transnational declarations, international norms and standards, or company guidelines.","source_file":"1.2.2.3 LR - Human-AI Collaboration in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["criteria","work","configurations","engagements","challenges","development","allows","discourse","ai","contextualization"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential.

This study seeks to fill this gap in the research by: (1) assessing the relative impact of SCV sources, and (2) proposing means to deal with them.

Subsequently, the paper applies the Nominal Group Technique with the same group of practitioners in order to identify and condense strategies for dealing with the most impactful sources of SCV (intra-organizational misalignment, inaccurate forecasting, long lead times, erratic behavior of decision makers in the supply chain, erratic behavior of customers, and high level of competition), leading to a set of 44 SCV-management strategies.","source_file":"1.2.2.4 LR - Challenges and Limitations of LLMs in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["scv","supply","chain","sources","research","areas","manage","relative","impact","practitioners"],"revised_keywords":["1.

In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers\u2019 influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 decisions. When taking into account retailers\u2019 buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer\u2019s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

However, SGD performs poorly when applied to train networks on non-ideal analog hardware composed of resistive device arrays with non-symmetric conductance modulation characteristics. Recently we proposed a new algorithm, the Tiki-Taka algorithm, that overcomes this stringent symmetry requirement. Here we build on top of Tiki-Taka and describe a more robust algorithm that further relaxes other stringent hardware requirements. This more robust second version of the Tiki-Taka algorithm (referred to as TTv2) 1. decreases the number of device conductance states requirement from 1000s of states to only 10s of states, 2. increases the noise tolerance to the device conductance modulations by about 100x, and 3. increases the noise tolerance to the matrix-vector multiplication performed by the analog arrays by about 10x. Empirical simulation results show that TTv2 can train various neural networks close to their ideal accuracy even at extremely noisy hardware settings. TTv2 achieves these capabilities by complementing the original Tiki-Taka algorithm with lightweight and low computational complexity digital filtering operations performed outside the analog arrays. Therefore, the implementation cost of TTv2 compared to SGD and Tiki-Taka is minimal, and it maintains the usual power and speed benefits of using analog hardware for training workloads. Here we also show how to extract the neural network from the analog hardware once the training is complete for further model deployment. Similar to Bayesian model averaging, we form analog hardware compatible averages over the neural network weights derived from TTv2 iterates. This model average then can be transferred to another analog or digital hardware with notable improvements in test accuracy, transcending the trained model itself. In short, we describe an end-to-end training and model extraction technique for extremely noisy crossbar-based analog hardware that can be used to accelerate DNN training workloads and match the performance of full-precision SGD.","source_file":"1.2.2.4 LR - Challenges and Limitations of LLMs in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["analog","hardware","algorithm","model","neural","sgd","training","networks","device","arrays"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Noisy Hardware Training:** This captures the core challenge addressed by the paper.\n2. **Tiki-Taka Algorithm:** This highlights the specific algorithm developed and improved upon.\n3. **Analog Neural Networks:** This emphasizes the hardware and application domain.\n4. **Low-Precision Training:** This reflects the reduced conductance states requirement.\n5. **Noise Tolerance:**  This points to a key improvement of the TTv2 algorithm.\n6. **Model Extraction:** This covers the novel aspect of transferring the trained model."]}

Despite the benefits of using pre-conceptual schemas by humans, they present challenges when interpreted by computers. We propose an approach to making computers able to interpret the basic pre-conceptual schemas made by humans. To do that, the construction of a linguistic corpus is required to work with large language models\u2014LLM. The linguistic corpus was mainly fed using Master\u2019s and doctoral theses from the digital repository of the University of Nari\u00f1o to produce a training dataset for re-training the BERT model; in addition, we complement this by explaining the elicited sentences in triads from the pre-conceptual schemas using one of the cutting-edge large language models in natural language processing: Llama 2-Chat by Meta AI. The diverse topics covered in these theses allowed us to expand the spectrum of linguistic use in the BERT model and empower the generative capabilities using the fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat model and the proposed solution. As a result, the first version of a computational solution was built to consume the language models based on BERT and Llama 2-Chat and thus automatically interpret pre-conceptual schemas by computers via natural language processing, adding, at the same time, generative capabilities. The validation of the computational solution was performed in two phases: the first one for detecting sentences and interacting with pre-conceptual schemas with students in the Formal Languages and Automata Theory course\u2014the seventh semester of the systems engineering undergraduate program at the University of Nari\u00f1o\u2019s Tumaco campus.

In vivo gastral images obtained by a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) were the subject of visual explanations, with the goal of increasing health professionals\u2019 trust in black-box predictions. We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that, with future improvements in implementation, can be generalized to different medical data sets and can provide effective decision support to medical experts.","source_file":"1.2.2.4 LR - Challenges and Limitations of LLMs in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["explanations","methods","three","support","medical","lime","shap","explainable","ciu","human"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Despite technological advancements, unavoidable AV accidents that result in life-and-death consequences cannot be completely eliminated. The emerging social concern of how an AV should make ethical decisions during unavoidable accidents is referred to as the moral dilemma of AV, which has promoted heated discussions among various stakeholders. However, there are research gaps in explainable AV ethical decision-making processes that predict how AVs\u2019 moral behaviors are made that are acceptable from the AV users\u2019 perspectives. This study addresses the key question: What factors affect ethical behavioral intentions in the AV moral dilemma? To answer this question, this study draws theories from multidisciplinary research fields to propose the \u201cIntegrative ethical decision-making framework for the AV moral dilemma.\u201d The framework includes four interdependent ethical decision-making stages: AV moral dilemma issue framing, intuitive moral reasoning, rational moral reasoning, and ethical behavioral intention making. Further, the framework includes variables (e.g., perceived moral intensity, individual factors, and personal moral philosophies) that influence the ethical decision-making process. For instance, the framework explains that AV users from Eastern cultures will tend to endorse a situationist ethics position (high idealism and high relativism), which views that ethical decisions are relative to context, compared to AV users from Western cultures. This proposition is derived from the link between individual factors and personal moral philosophy. Moreover, the framework proposes a dual-process theory, which explains that both intuitive and rational moral reasoning are integral processes of ethical decision-making during the AV moral dilemma. Further, this framework describes that ethical behavioral intentions that lead to decisions in the AV moral dilemma are not fixed, but are based on how an individual perceives the seriousness of the situation, which is shaped by their personal moral philosophy. This framework provides a step-by-step explanation of how pluralistic ethical decision-making occurs, reducing the abstractness of AV moral reasoning processes.","source_file":"1.2.2.4 LR - Challenges and Limitations of LLMs in SCM.csv","extracted_keywords":["moral","av","ethical","framework","dilemma","decisions","reasoning","processes","users","factors"],"revised_keywords":["1.

This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI\u2019s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5\u00d7 semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students.

Various strategies and guidelines highlight the concept as a key goal. However, we argue that current uses of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) in policy documents and AI strategies risk downplaying promises of creating desirable, emancipatory technology that promotes human wellbeing and the common good. Firstly, HCAI, as it appears in policy discourses, is the result of aiming to adapt the concept of human-centered design (HCD) to the public governance context of AI but without proper reflection on how it should be reformed to suit the new task environment. Second, the concept is mainly used in reference to realizing human and fundamental rights, which are necessary, but not sufficient for technological emancipation. Third, the concept is used ambiguously in policy and strategy discourses, making it unclear how it should be operationalized in governance practices. This article explores means and approaches for using the HCAI approach for technological emancipation in the context of public AI governance. We propose that the potential for emancipatory technology development rests on expanding the traditional user-centered view of technology design to involve community- and society-centered perspectives in public governance. Developing public AI governance in this way relies on enabling inclusive governance modalities that enhance the social sustainability of AI deployment. We discuss mutual trust, transparency, communication, and civic tech as key prerequisites for socially sustainable and human-centered public AI governance.

Despite technological advancements, unavoidable AV accidents that result in life-and-death consequences cannot be completely eliminated. The emerging social concern of how an AV should make ethical decisions during unavoidable accidents is referred to as the moral dilemma of AV, which has promoted heated discussions among various stakeholders. However, there are research gaps in explainable AV ethical decision-making processes that predict how AVs\u2019 moral behaviors are made that are acceptable from the AV users\u2019 perspectives. This study addresses the key question: What factors affect ethical behavioral intentions in the AV moral dilemma? To answer this question, this study draws theories from multidisciplinary research fields to propose the \u201cIntegrative ethical decision-making framework for the AV moral dilemma.\u201d The framework includes four interdependent ethical decision-making stages: AV moral dilemma issue framing, intuitive moral reasoning, rational moral reasoning, and ethical behavioral intention making. Further, the framework includes variables (e.g., perceived moral intensity, individual factors, and personal moral philosophies) that influence the ethical decision-making process. For instance, the framework explains that AV users from Eastern cultures will tend to endorse a situationist ethics position (high idealism and high relativism), which views that ethical decisions are relative to context, compared to AV users from Western cultures. This proposition is derived from the link between individual factors and personal moral philosophy. Moreover, the framework proposes a dual-process theory, which explains that both intuitive and rational moral reasoning are integral processes of ethical decision-making during the AV moral dilemma. Further, this framework describes that ethical behavioral intentions that lead to decisions in the AV moral dilemma are not fixed, but are based on how an individual perceives the seriousness of the situation, which is shaped by their personal moral philosophy. This framework provides a step-by-step explanation of how pluralistic ethical decision-making occurs, reducing the abstractness of AV moral reasoning processes.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["moral","av","ethical","framework","dilemma","decisions","reasoning","processes","users","factors"],"revised_keywords":["1.

One of these linguistic biases is known as the implicit causality bias, wherein language users anticipate that certain entities will be rementioned in the discourse based on the entity's particular role in an expressed causal event. For example, when language users encounter a sentence like \u201cElizabeth congratulated Tina\u2026\u201d during real-time language processing, they seemingly anticipate that the discourse will continue about Tina, the object referent, rather than Elizabeth, the subject referent. However, it is often unclear how these reference biases are acquired and how exactly they get used during real-time language processing. In order to investigate these questions, we developed a reference learning model within the PRIMs cognitive architecture that simulated the process of predicting upcoming discourse referents and their linguistic forms. Crucially, across the linguistic input the model was presented with, there were asymmetries with respect to how the discourse continued. By utilizing the learning mechanisms of the PRIMs architecture, the model was able to optimize its predictions, ultimately leading to biased model behavior. More specifically, following subject-biased implicit causality verbs the model was more likely to predict that the discourse would continue about the subject referent, whereas following object-biased implicit causality verbs the model was more likely to predict that the discourse would continue about the object referent. In a similar fashion, the model was more likely to predict that subject referent continuations would be in the form of a pronoun, whereas object referent continuations would be in the form of a proper name. These learned biases were also shown to generalize to novel contexts in which either the verb or the subject and object referents were new. The results of the present study demonstrate that seemingly complex linguistic behavior can be explained by cognitively plausible domain-general learning mechanisms.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized.

This dilemma motivates us to investigate the value of coordinating decisions on prices and capacity allocation in a stylized setting. We propose two pairs of sequential policies for making static decisions-on pricing and revenue management-that differ in their degree of integration (hierarchical versus coordinated) and their pricing inputs (deterministic versus stochastic). For a large class of stochastic, price-dependent demand models, we prove that these four heuristics admit tractable solutions satisfying intuitive sensitivity properties. We further evaluate numerically the performance of these policies relative to a fully coordinated model, which is generally intractable. We find it interesting that near-optimal performance is usually achieved by a simple hierarchical policy that sets prices first, based on a nonnested stochastic model, and then uses these prices to optimize nested capacity allocation. This tractable policy largely outperforms its counterpart based on a deterministic pricing model. Jointly optimizing price and allocation decisions for the high-end segment improves performance, but the largest revenue benefits stem from adjusting prices to account for demand risk.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["pricing","revenue","prices","allocation","stochastic","performance","model","integration","decisions","capacity"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Revenue Management** (broader term encompassing pricing)\n2. **Pricing Optimization** (focuses on the optimization aspect)\n3. **Capacity Allocation** (key element of the problem)\n4. **Stochastic Demand** (highlights the nature of the demand model)\n5. **Coordination Policies** (central theme of the research)\n6. **Hierarchical Control** (describes a key policy approach)"]}

However, despite their rising importance, questions regarding how they function and how reliable they are to support decision-making have so far escaped scholarly attention.

We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings.

Large data volumes extracted from the banking transactions that represent customers\u2019 behavior are available, but processing loan applications is a complex and time-consuming task for banking institutions. In 2022, over 20 million Americans had open loans, totaling USD 178 billion in debt, although over 20% of loan applications were rejected. Numerous statistical methods have been deployed to estimate loan risks opening the field to estimate whether machine learning techniques can better predict the potential risks. To study the machine learning paradigm in this sector, the mental health dataset and loan approval dataset presenting survey results from 1991 individuals are used as inputs to experiment with the credit risk prediction ability of the chosen machine learning algorithms. Giving a comprehensive comparative analysis, this paper shows how the chosen machine learning algorithms can distinguish between normal and risky loan customers who might never pay their debts back.

In the second dataset, random forest achieved the highest accuracy of 85%, followed by decision tree and KNN with 83%. Alongside accuracy, the precision, recall, and overall performance of the algorithms were tested and a confusion matrix analysis was performed producing numerical results that emphasized the superior performance of XGBoost and random forest in the classification tasks in the first dataset, and XGBoost and decision tree in the second dataset.

The number of samples in each class is not uniformly distributed; one class contains a large number of samples while the other has a small number. Overfitting of the model occurs as a result of imbalanced datasets, resulting in poor performance. In this study, we compare different oversampling techniques like synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), support vector machine SMOTE (SVM-SMOTE), Border-line SMOTE, K-means SMOTE, and adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) oversampling to address the issue of imbalanced datasets and enhance the performance of machine learning models. Preprocessing significantly enhances the quality of input data by reducing noise, redundant data, and unnecessary data. This enables the machines to identify crucial patterns that facilitate the extraction of significant and pertinent information from the preprocessed data. This study preprocesses the data using various top-level preprocessing steps. Furthermore, two imbalanced Twitter datasets are used to compare the performance of oversampling techniques with six machine learning models including random forest (RF), SVM, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost (ADA), logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT). In addition, the bag of words (BoW) and term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features extraction approaches are used to extract features from the tweets. The experiments indicate that SMOTE and ADASYN perform much better than other techniques thus providing higher accuracy. Additionally, overall results show that SVM with \u2019linear\u2019 kernel tends to attain the highest accuracy and recall score of 99.67% and 1.00% on ADASYN oversampled datasets and 99.57% accuracy on SMOTE oversampled dataset with TF-IDF features.

Unfortunately, they may show \"Clever Hans\"-like behavior-making use of confounding factors within datasets-to achieve high performance.In this work, we introduce the novel learning setting of \"explanatory interactive learning\" (XIL) and illustrate its benefits on a plant phenotyping research task. XIL adds the scientist into the training loop, such that she interactively revises the original model via providing feedback on its explanations. Our experimental results demonstrate that XIL can help to avoid Clever Hans moments in machine learning and encourages (or discourages, if appropriate) trust into the underlying model. 1Imagine a plant phenotyping team attempting to characterize crop resistance to plant pathogens. The plant physiologist records a large amount of hyperspectral imaging data. Impressed by the results of deep learning in other scientific areas, she wants to establish similar results for phenotyping. Consequently, she asks a machine learning expert to apply deep learning to analyze the data. Luckily, the resulting predictive accuracy is very high. The plant physiologist, however, remains skeptical. The results are \"too good, to be true\". Checking the decision process of the deep model using explainable artificial intelligence (AI), the machine learning expert is flabbergasted to find that the learned deep model uses clues within the data that do not relate to the biological problem at hand, so-called confounding factors.The physiologist loses trust in AI and turns away from it, proclaiming it to be useless. This example encapsulates a critical issue of current explainable AI [1, 2]. Indeed, the seminal paper of Lapuschkin et al.[3] helps in \"unmasking Clever Hans predictors and assessing what machines really learn\", however, rather than proclaiming, as the plant physiologist might, that the machines have learned the right predictions for the wrong reasons and can therefore not be trusted, we here showcase that interactions between the learning system and the human user can correct the model, towards making the right predictions for the right reasons [4]. This may also increase the trust in machine learning models. Actually, trust lies at the foundation of major theories of interpersonal relationships in psychology [5, 6], and we argue that interaction and understandability are central to trust in learning machines. Surprisingly, the link between interacting, explaining, and building trust has been largely ignored by the machine learning literature. Existing approaches focus on passive learning only and do not consider the interaction between the user and the learner [7,8,9], whereas, interactive learning frameworks such as active [10] and coactive learning [11] do not consider the issue of trust. In active learning, for instance, the model presents unlabeled instances to a user, and in exchange, obtains their label. This is completely opaque-the user is oblivious to the models beliefs and reasons for predictions...","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["learning","trust","plant","model","deep","machine","results","physiologist","user","clever"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: This is central to the paper's methodology and addresses the core problem.\n2. **Interactive Learning**:  The paper introduces a novel approach to learning","highlighting its interaction component.\n3. **Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning**: This captures the essence of the scientist's involvement in the training process.\n4. **Deep Learning Interpretability**: This focuses on understanding the decisions made by the deep learning model.\n5. **Confounding Factors**: This addresses the specific problem of \"Clever Hans\" behavior in machine learning models.\n6. **Trust in AI**: This is a key outcome and motivation of the proposed approach."]}

In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM\u2019s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized.

Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system (i.e., agent society) is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, i.e., the complete system can be regarded as a single agent performing multimodal categorization using the sensors of all agents, if we define the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence, i.e., forming and sharing signs and categories, is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the real-world environment. In the experiment, we compared three communication algorithms: no communication, no rejection, and the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher who would know a pre-existing symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system can form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing categories.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["system","symbol","agents","emergence","communication","model","semiotic","signs","categories","agent"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Symbol Emergence:** This captures the core topic of the research.\n2. **Multi-agent Systems:**  Highlights the computational model's key architecture.\n3. **Semiotic Communication:** Specifies the type of communication modeled.\n4. **Multimodal Categorization:**  Describes the cognitive process involved.\n5. **Computational Model:**  Indicates the methodological approach.\n6. **Language Evolution:**  Places the research within a broader theoretical context."]}

Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a field experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared with the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss of 21.7%. Furthermore, we report on results from a postexperimental rollout of the decision model, which also resulted in significant yield improvements.

The main advantages of the multi-criteria decision-making principle (MCDM) in financial decision-making are the ability to structure complex evaluation tasks that allow for well-founded financial decisions, the application of quantitative and qualitative criteria in the analysis process, the possibility of transparency of evaluation and the introduction of improved, universal and practical academic methods to the financial decision-making process. This article presents a review and classification of multi-criteria decision-making methods that help to achieve the goal of forthcoming research: to create artificial intelligence-based methods that are explainable, transparent, and interpretable for most investment decision-makers.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["financial","methods","artificial","need","make","explainable","main","practical","decisions","evaluation"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["biases","teachers","technologies","research","education","strategies","studies","systems","models","applications"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The objectives of this study are (a) to explore and identify potential and possible criteria to be incorporated in the current flood management plan in the macro domain perspective; (b) to understand the type of flood measures and decision goals implemented to facilitate flood management planning decisions; and (c) to examine the possible structured mechanism for criteria selection based on the decision analysis technique. Based on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis using the PESTEL framework, the findings have identified and clustered domains and their criteria to be considered and applied in future flood management plans. The critical review on flood measures and decision goals would potentially equip stakeholders and policy makers for better decision making based on a disaster management plan. The decision analysis technique as a structured mechanism would significantly improve criteria identification and selection for comprehensive and collective decisions. The findings from this study could further improve Malaysia Adaptation Index (MAIN) criteria identification and selection, which could be the complementary and supporting reference in managing flood disaster management.

The algorithm is designed to facilitate the estimation of heuristic relevance regardless of the number of items per heuristic or the item scale, thereby streamlining the evaluation process.

We further developed eight regression models for LoS prediction: Linear Regression (LR), including the penalized linear models Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge and Elastic-net regression, Support vector regression, RF regression, KNN, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression. The model performances were measured by their mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean relative error. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%).ResultsA total of 12,858 eligible patients were included in our study, of whom 60.88% had a PloS. The GB classifier best predicted PloS (accuracy 75%, AUC 75.4%, Brier score 0.181), followed by LoR classifier (accuracy 75%, AUC 75.2%, Brier score 0.182). These models also showed to be adequately calibrated. Ridge and XGBoost regressions best predicted LoS, with the smallest total prediction error. The overall prediction error is between 6 and 7 days, meaning there is a 6\u20137 day mean difference between actual and predicted LoS.ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of machine learning-based methods to predict LoS and provide valuable insights into the risks behind prolonged hospitalizations. In addition to physicians' clinical expertise, the results of these models can be utilized as input to make informed decisions, such as predicting hospitalizations and enhancing the overall performance of a public healthcare system.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["regression","models","los","plos","error","prediction","mean","brier","score","auc"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The computational approach based on FEAHP automates supplier selection by determining a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. First, the criteria and sub-criteria specific to the selection problem were identified by the experts taking the relevant literature as a starting point. Next, the experts performed a pair-wise comparison of the predefined requirements using a linguistic scale. This evaluation was then quantified by calculating the priority weights of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The best decision alternative is the one with the highest final score. Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the results of the proposed model. The FEAHP computer approach automated the supplier selection process in a rational, flexible, and agile way, as perceived by the focal company.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["biases","teachers","technologies","research","education","strategies","studies","systems","models","applications"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Thus, decision-makers have abundantly available alternatives to choose from the best one or rank from the most to the least preferred. However, in the multicriteria decision-making field, most tools support a limited number of alternatives with as narrow criteria as possible. Decision-makers are forced to apply a screening or filtering method to reduce the size of the problem, which will slow down the process and eliminate some potential alternatives from the rest of the decision-making process. Implementing MCDM methods in high-performance parallel and distributed computing environments becomes crucial to ensure the scalability of multicriteria decision-making solutions in Big Data contexts, where one can consider a vast number of alternatives, each being described on the basis of a number of criteria.In this context, we consider TOPSIS one of the most widely used MCDM methods. We present a parallel implementation of TOPSIS based on the MapReduce paradigm. This solution will reduce the response time of the decision-making process and facilitate the analysis of the robustness and sensitivity of the method in a high-dimension problem at a reasonable response time.Three multicriteria analysis problems were evaluated to show the proposed approach's computational efficiency and performance.

The use of DST mathematical tools makes it possible to avoid a set of limitations and drawbacks revealed recently in the conventional Atanassov\u2019s operational laws defined on intuitionistic fuzzy values, which may produce unacceptable results in the solution of multiple criteria decision-making problems. This boosts considerably the quality of aggregating operators used in the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method. It is pointed out that the conventional TOPSIS method may be naturally treated as a weighted sum of some modified local criteria. Because this aggregating approach does not always reflects well intentions of decision makers, two additional aggregating methods that cannot be defined in the framework of conventional A IFS based on local criteria weights being intuitionistic fuzzy values, are introduced. Having in mind that different aggregating methods generally produce different alternative rankings to obtain the compromise ranking, the method for aggregating of aggregation modes has been applied. Some examples are used to illustrate the validity and features of the proposed approach.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["intuitionistic","fuzzy","aggregating","topsis","conventional","criteria","method","solution","based","theory"],"revised_keywords":["1.

It is also important to create favorable conditions for economic activity while respecting the environment. One of the most important dimensions of this concept is security in the broadest sense, particularly that which concerns urban residents. This article addresses this subject by analyzing crime and determining the state of safety in 16 Polish provincial cities between 2013\u20132022. The measure of this state was chosen to be a set of indicators characterizing a number of registered criminal and economic offenses in the studied cities. On this basis, values of the indices of the dynamics of change for these offenses in individual cities in the analyzed period were determined. In the next stage, the number of offenses was compared to the number of residents of the cities under study and the indices of concentration for total offenses (LQT) and for individual types of offenses (LQn) were determined. Based on these results, the studied cities were divided into four concentration levels. Afterward, these results were used for a multi-criteria analysis of the safety of studied cities, which was carried out using the TOPSIS method. The calculated values of the safety index (Pi) formed the basis for creating a ranking and specifying security levels of studied cities. The results indicate a wide variation among the cities in terms of safety levels. Gda\u0144sk, Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn and Zielona G\u00f3ra were found to be the safest cities, while Szczecin was found to be the least safe. The methodology developed and the results obtained show the validity of conducting comparative research in areas relevant to the implementation of the smart cities concept.

Given the recent advances in single-agent reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has gained tremendous interest in recent years. Most research studies apply a fully centralized learning scheme to ease the transfer from the single-agent domain to multi-agent systems.Methods: In contrast, we claim that a decentralized learning scheme is preferable for applications in real-world scenarios as this allows deploying a learning algorithm on an individual robot rather than deploying the algorithm to a complete fleet of robots. Therefore, this article outlines a novel actor\u2013critic (AC) approach tailored to cooperative MARL problems in sparsely rewarded domains. Our approach decouples the MARL problem into a set of distributed agents that model the other agents as responsive entities. In particular, we propose using two separate critics per agent to distinguish between the joint task reward and agent-based costs as commonly applied within multi-robot planning. On one hand, the agent-based critic intends to decrease agent-specific costs. On the other hand, each agent intends to optimize the joint team reward based on the joint task critic. As this critic still depends on the joint action of all agents, we outline two suitable behavior models based on Stackelberg games: a game against nature and a dyadic game against each agent. Following these behavior models, our algorithm allows fully decentralized execution and training.Results and Discussion: We evaluate our presented method using the proposed behavior models within a sparsely rewarded simulated multi-agent environment. Although our approach already outperforms the state-of-the-art learners, we conclude this article by outlining possible extensions of our algorithm that future research may build upon.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["learning","algorithm","joint","research","approach","agents","agent","critic","behavior","models"],"revised_keywords":["1.

In real-world settings, such as soft fruit farms, human labourers undertake harvesting tasks. The harvesting workforce is typically organised by farm manager(s) who assign workers to the fields that are ready to be harvested and team leaders who manage the workers in the fields. Creating these assignments is a dynamic and complex problem, as the skill of the workforce and the yield (quantity of ripe fruit picked) are variable and not entirely predictable. The work presented here posits that multi-agent task allocation methods can assist farm managers and team leaders to manage the harvesting workforce effectively and efficiently. There are three key challenges faced when adapting multi-agent approaches to this problem: (i) staff time (and thus cost) should be minimised; (ii) tasks must be distributed fairly to keep staff motivated; and (iii) the approach must be able to handle incremental (incomplete) data as the season progresses. An adapted variation of Round Robin (RR) is proposed for the problem of assigning workers to fields, and market-based task allocation mechanisms are applied to the challenge of assigning tasks to workers within the fields. To evaluate the approach introduced here, experiments are performed based on data that was supplied by a large commercial soft fruit farm for the past two harvesting seasons. The results demonstrate that our approach produces appropriate worker-to-field allocations.

Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system (i.e., agent society) is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, i.e., the complete system can be regarded as a single agent performing multimodal categorization using the sensors of all agents, if we define the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence, i.e., forming and sharing signs and categories, is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the real-world environment. In the experiment, we compared three communication algorithms: no communication, no rejection, and the proposed algorithm.

This study seeks to fill this gap in the research by: (1) assessing the relative impact of SCV sources, and (2) proposing means to deal with them. Based on an Analytical Hierarchy Process conducted with 17 SCM practitioners, the paper assesses the relative impact of sources of SCV, and further contextualizes them according to factors such as product lead time and production strategy, providing more fine-grained insights for SC managers seeking to manage SCV. Subsequently, the paper applies the Nominal Group Technique with the same group of practitioners in order to identify and condense strategies for dealing with the most impactful sources of SCV (intra-organizational misalignment, inaccurate forecasting, long lead times, erratic behavior of decision makers in the supply chain, erratic behavior of customers, and high level of competition), leading to a set of 44 SCV-management strategies.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["scv","supply","chain","sources","research","areas","manage","relative","impact","practitioners"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized.

The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA\u2019s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements.

Empirical studies examining post-adoption conditions that facilitate performance improvement still remain scarce. In this study we focus on procurement as part of the supply chain management activities. We apply the business-IT alignment perspective to the domain of procurement, and examine how certain organizational factors impact the attainment of this state. Additionally, we research the effect that procurement alignment has on supply chain management performance. In order to do so, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis on a sample of 172 European companies. We find that firms that opt for a centralized governance structure, as well as larger firms, are more likely to attain a state of procurement alignment. Furthermore, our results empirically support the statement that procurement alignment is positively correlated with operational efficiency and competitive performance of the supply chain.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["supply","chain","procurement","management","alignment","activities","performance","research","examining","studies"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA\u2019s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements.

In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead.

Strikingly, variance does not influence risk perception, even though return volatility is the most common risk measure in finance in both academia and the industry. When testing other, compound risk measures, the probability to experience losses is the strongest predictor of what is perceived as being risky. Analyzing professionals' propensity to invest, skewness and loss probability have strong predictive power too. However, volatility and kurtosis also have some additional effect on participants' willingness to invest. Our results are very similar for lay people, and they are robust across and within countries with different cultural backgrounds as well as for different job fields of professionals.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["risk","professionals","financial","finance","return","perceived","lay","people","countries","world"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Risk Perception:** This captures the central theme of the study.\n2. **Financial Risk:**  Specifies the type of risk being investigated.\n3. **Skewness:** Highlights the key finding regarding the influence of skewness on risk perception.\n4. **Investment Decisions:** Reflects the application of risk perception in real-world scenarios.\n5. **Global Survey:**  Indicates the scope and methodology of the research.\n6. **Financial Professionals vs. Laypeople:** Emphasizes the comparative analysis between the two groups."]}

Here, we focus on this gap and present experimental work that systematically studies the effect of risk of injury on the decisions people make in these dilemmas. In four experiments, participants were asked to program their AVs to either save five pedestrians, which we refer to as the utilitarian choice, or save the driver, which we refer to as the nonutilitarian choice. The results indicate that most participants made the utilitarian choice but that this choice was moderated in important ways by perceived risk to the driver and risk to the pedestrians. As a second contribution, we demonstrate the value of formulating AV moral dilemmas in a game-theoretic framework that considers the possible influence of others\u2019 behavior. In the fourth experiment, we show that participants were more (less) likely to make the utilitarian choice, the more utilitarian (nonutilitarian) other drivers behaved; furthermore, unlike the game-theoretic prediction that decision-makers inevitably converge to nonutilitarianism, we found significant evidence of utilitarianism. We discuss theoretical implications for our understanding of human decision-making in moral dilemmas and practical guidelines for the design of autonomous machines that solve these dilemmas while, at the same time, being likely to be adopted in practice.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["dilemmas","risk","choice","utilitarian","moral","make","decisions","participants","autonomous","machines"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT\u2019s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs\u2019 exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system.","source_file":"1.2.2.5 LR - Decision-Making Processes.csv","extracted_keywords":["health","aihts","ai","hta","exceptional","healthcare","system","challenges","impacts","care"],"revised_keywords":["1.

During evacuations the sharing of resources and vehicles is a crucial mechanism for expanding critical capacity and enabling inclusive disaster response. This paper examines the complexity of rideshare decision-making in the wake of simultaneous emergencies. Specifically, the need for physical distancing measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic complicates face-to-face resource sharing between strangers. The ability of on-demand ridesharing to provide emergency transportation to individuals without access to alternatives calls for an understanding of how evacuees weigh risks of contagion against benefits of spontaneous resource sharing. In this research, we examine both sociodemographic and situational factors that contribute to a willingness to share flood evacuation rides with strangers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the willingness to share is significantly correlated with traditional emergency resource sharing motivations and current COVID-19 risk factors. To test these hypotheses, we distributed an online survey during the pandemic surge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern states in the United States with high risk of flooding. We estimate a random parameter multinomial logit model to determine the willingness to share a ride as a driver or passenger. Our findings show that willingness to share evacuation rides is associated with individual sociodemographics (such as being female, under 36\u00a0years old, Black, or republican-identifying) and the social environment (such as households with children, social network proximity, and neighborly sharing attitudes). Moreover, our findings suggest higher levels of income, COVID-19 threat perception, evacuation fear, and household preparedness all correspond with a lower willingness to share rides.

Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized.

Most of the literature on trust in automation identified the performance of the agent as a key factor influencing trust.

The state-of-the-art systems have mostly focussed on improving the redundancy of the system, adopting decentralized control architectures, and utilizing distributed sensing capabilities. While machine learning approaches for efficient distribution and allocation of skills and tasks have enhanced the potential of these systems, they are still limited when presented with dynamic environments. To move beyond the current limitations, this paper advocates incorporating counterfactual learning models for agents to enable them with the ability to predict possible future conditions and adjust their behavior. Counterfactual learning is a topic that has recently been gaining attention as a model-agnostic and post-hoc technique to improve explainability in machine learning models. Using counterfactual causality can also help gain insights into unforeseen circumstances and make inferences about the probability of desired outcomes. We propose that this can be used in agent systems as a means to guide and prepare them to cope with unanticipated environmental conditions. This supplementary support for adaptation can enable the design of more intelligent and complex autonomous agent systems to address the multifaceted characteristics of real-world problem domains.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["systems","learning","agent","dynamic","conditions","counterfactual","resilience","autonomous","complex","environments"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Autonomous Agent Resilience:** This combines two major themes of the paper.\n2. **Counterfactual Learning:** This is the core proposed method.\n3. **Dynamic Environments:**  Highlights a key challenge addressed.\n4. **Adaptive Systems:** Captures the goal of improving system adaptability.\n5. **System Resilience:** A broader term encompassing the specific agent resilience.\n6. **AI Explainability:** Connects to the benefits of counterfactual learning mentioned in the abstract."]}

The emergence of \"intelligent things\" (static or mobile) in collaborative autonomous fleets requires new architectures, connectivity paradigms, trustworthiness frameworks, and platforms for the integration of applications across different business and industrial domains. These new applications accelerate the development of autonomous system design paradigms and the proliferation of the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT).

However, whenever self-organization was demonstrated on physical platforms (e.g., robot swarms), this was performed mostly within controlled laboratory conditions. The real world comes with severe requirements, calling for robust design methodologies, their standardization, and validation via benchmarking toolsets. With this Research Topic, we collect, benchmark, and survey novel approaches to push self-organization toward real-world applications, focusing on embodied artificial systems, such as multi-robot, cyber-physical, and socio-technical systems. We start with six perspective and survey papers that give a good overview of the state of the art and challenges of real-world implementations. Gershenson studies the complexity of cyber-physical systems. After reviewing basic concepts that are useful to design self-organizing systems, he introduces approaches to implement self-organization in cyber-physical systems. Gershenson reviews three case studies from different domains. Crowd control is related to a passive control approach using signs to mediate passenger boarding and descent in Mexico City Metro. In a traffic light case study, traffic lights and vehicles interact closely as agents, resulting in a network of streets and crossings with self-organized coordination of traffic flows. The third case study is related to public transport and addresses the equal headway instability. Trains use bio-inspired pheromone systems to keep equal distance to the vehicles in front and behind. The result is a flexible system where trains can quickly adapt and respond to service delays. Gershenson provides an outlook for cyber-physical and cyber-social systems controlled by guided self-organization. Based on the above-mentioned benefits of self-organization the motivation is strong to apply swarm robotics in industrial applications. However, many industrial applications still rely on centralized control. In cases where a multi-robot solution is employed, the main idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision-making is often not implemented. Schranz et al. provide a collection and categorization of swarm robotic behaviors.

To enable automated dispatching processes, this article presents a multiagent system where the decision making is shifted to autonomous, interacting, intelligent agents. Beside the communication protocols and the agent architecture, the focus is on the individual decision making of the agents which meets the specific requirements in groupage traffic. To evaluate the approach we apply multiagent-based simulation and model several scenarios of real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, a case study is conducted which covers the autonomous groupage traffic in the current processes of our industrial parter. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the sophisticated requirements of groupage traffic.

This is done by integrating a DRL agent at a high level of vehicle control and leveraging existing path planning and proven low-level control methodologies that are utilized in multiple domains. An autonomy package with a tertiary multilevel controller is developed to enable the DRL agent to interface at the prescribed high control level and thus be separated from vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints.

Modern ML models have become more complex, deeper, and harder to reason about. At the same time, the community has started to realize the importance of protecting the privacy of the training data that goes into these models.\nDifferential Privacy (DP) has become a gold standard for making formal statements about data anonymization. However, while some adoption of DP has happened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are still few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical guidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and the difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility-computation trade-offs for ML models. Tricks for tuning and maximizing performance are scattered among papers or stored in the heads of practitioners, particularly with respect to the challenging task of hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the literature seems to present conflicting evidence on how and whether to apply architectural adjustments and which components are \u201csafe\u201d to use with DP.\nIn this survey paper, we attempt to create a self-contained guide that gives an in-depth overview of the field of DP ML. We aim to assemble information about achieving the best possible DP ML model with rigorous privacy guarantees. Our target audience is both researchers and practitioners. Researchers interested in DP for ML will benefit from a clear overview of current advances and areas for improvement.

For both researchers and practitioners, consistently and fully reporting privacy guarantees is critical, so we propose a set of specific best practices for stating guarantees.\nWith sufficient computation and a sufficiently large training set or supplemental nonprivate data, both good accuracy (that is, almost as good as a non-private model) and good privacy can often be achievable. And even when computation and dataset size are limited, there are advantages to training with even a weak (but still finite) formal DP guarantee. Hence, we hope this work will facilitate more widespread deployments of DP ML models.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["dp","ml","privacy","models","training","guarantees","good","data","tuning","practitioners"],"revised_keywords":["1.

However, studies have indicated that E. coli testing can present an economic burden to growers and that time lags between sampling and obtaining results may reduce the utility of these data. Models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may provide a mechanism for overcoming these obstacles. Thus, this proof-of-concept study uses previously published datasets to train, test, and compare E. coli predictive models using multiple algorithms and performance measures. Since the collection of different feature data carries specific costs for growers, predictive performance was compared for models built using different feature types [geospatial, water quality, stream traits, and\/or weather features]. Model performance was assessed against baseline regression models. Model performance varied considerably with root-mean-squared errors and Kendall\u2019s Tau ranging between 0.37 and 1.03, and 0.07 and 0.55, respectively. Overall, models that included turbidity, rain, and temperature outperformed all other models regardless of the algorithm used. Turbidity and weather factors were also found to drive model accuracy even when other feature types were included in the model. These findings confirm previous conclusions that machine learning models may be useful for predicting when, where, and at what level E. coli (and associated hazards) are likely to be present in preharvest agricultural water sources. This study also identifies specific algorithm-predictor combinations that should be the foci of future efforts to develop deployable models (i.e., models that can be used to guide on-farm decision-making and risk mitigation). When deploying E. coli predictive models in the field, it is important to note that past research indicates an inconsistent relationship between E. coli levels and foodborne pathogen presence. Thus, models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may be useful for assessing fecal contamination status and ensuring compliance with regulations but should not be used to assess the risk that specific pathogens of concern (e.g., Salmonella, Listeria) are present.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["models","coli","water","used","may","performance","model","risk","present","levels"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The complexity of the fertilizer supply chain motivated us to carry out this study on redesigning the fertilizer logistics chain and evaluate strategies for reducing logistics costs by redesigning the fertilizer mixing network in Brazil, a country that is heavily dependent on imported fertilizers for agriculture. Methods: We introduce a multi-product mixed-integer linear programming optimization model encompassing the logistics network, from import ports to mixing factories and agricultural fertilizer supply centers. This model includes logistics infrastructure and taxes, accounting for greenhouse gas emissions (specifically carbon dioxide) in fertilizer logistics. Results: The results indicate that expanding the port capacity for fertilizer importation can significantly reduce logistics costs and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 22.5%, decreasing by 23.9% compared to the baseline. We also observed that removing taxes on fertilizer importation can reduce logistics costs by approximately 11%, but it increases greenhouse gas emissions by 2.25% due to increased reliance on road transport. We identified 15 highly resilient regions for establishing mixing factories, evaluated various scenarios and determined the importance of these locations in optimizing the fertilizer supply network in the country. Moreover, the results suggest a significant potential to enhance the role of Brazil\u2019s Northern Arc region in fertilizer import flows. Conclusions: Public policies and private initiatives could be directed toward encouraging the establishment of mixing factories in the identified regions and increasing transport capacity in the Northern Arc region.

The current line of research aims to develop an efficient computer-aided detection system that will support doctors (and radiologists) to become well-informed when making TB diagnosis from patients' CXRs. Here, an integrated process to improve TB diagnostics via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and localization in CXRs via deep-learning models is proposed.

Comparisons of the overall performance are made across all three steps among the experimented deep CNN models on two publicly available CXR datasets, namely, the Shenzhen Hospital CXR dataset and the National Institutes of Health CXR dataset. Validated performance includes detecting CXR abnormalities and differentiating among seven TB-related manifestations (consolidation, effusion, fibrosis, infiltration, mass, nodule, and pleural thickening).

This advance is mostly owed to the ability of deep learning algorithms, that is, artificial neural networks with multiple processing layers, to model complex nonlinear inputoutput relationships, and perform pattern recognition and feature extraction from low-level data representations. Certain deep learning models have been shown to match or even exceed the performance of the familiar existing machine learning and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods for drug discovery 4-6. Moreover, deep learning has boosted the potential and broadened the applicability of computer-assisted discovery, for example, in molecular design 7,8 , chemical synthesis planning 9,10 , protein structure prediction 11 and macromolecular target identification 12,13. The ability to capture intricate nonlinear relationships between input data (for example, chemical structure representations) and the associated output (for example, assay readout) often comes at the price of limited comprehensibility of the resulting model. While there have been efforts to explain QSARs in terms of algorithmic insights and molecular descriptor analysis 14-19 , deep neural network models notoriously elude immediate accessibility by the human mind 20. In medicinal chemistry in particular, the availability of 'rules of thumb' correlating biological effects with physicochemical properties underscores the willingness, in certain situations, to sacrifice accuracy in favour of models that better fit human intuition 21-23. Thus, blurring the lines between the 'two QSARs' 24 (that is, mechanistically interpretable versus highly accurate models) may be key to accelerated drug discovery with AI 25.

In FPO, all of the particles are seen as predators. Only the competitive, powerful predator that are selected as an elite could achieve the limited opportunity to update. The elite generation with roulette wheel selection could increase individual independence and reduce rapid social collaboration. Experimental results show that FPO is able to provide excellent performance of global exploration and local minima avoidance simultaneously. However, to the higher dimensionality of multimodal problem, the slow convergence speed becomes the bottleneck of FPO. A dynamic team model is utilized in FPO, named DFPO to accelerate the early convergence rate. In this paper, DFPO is more precisely described and its variant, DFPO-r is proposed to improve the performance of DFPO. A method of team size selection is proposed in DFPO-r to increase population diversity. The population diversity is one of the most important factors that determines the performance of the optimization algorithm. A higher degree of population diversity is able to help DFPO-r alleviate a premature convergence. The strategy of selection is to choose team size according to the higher degree of population diversity. Ten well-known multimodal benchmark functions are used to evaluate the solution capability of DFPO and DFPO-r. Six benchmark functions are extensively set to 100 dimensions to investigate the performance of DFPO and DFPO-r compared with LBest PSO, Dolphin Partner Optimization and FPO.

However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate.

One response to unpredictability could be greater robot complexity and cost, but this seems counter to the \"swarm philosophy\" of deploying (very) large numbers of simple agents. Instead, here I argue that bioinspiration in swarm robotics has considerable untapped potential in relation to the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity: when a genotype can produce a range of distinctive changes in organismal behavior, physiology and morphology in response to different environments. This commonly arises following a natural history of variable conditions; implying the need for more diverse and hazardous simulated environments in offline, pre-deployment optimization of swarms. This will generate-indicate the need for-plasticity. Biological plasticity is sometimes irreversible; yet this characteristic remains relevant in the context of minimal swarms, where robots may become mass-producible. Plasticity can be introduced through the greater use of adaptive threshold-based behaviors; more fundamentally, it can link to emerging technologies such as smart materials, which can adapt form and function to environmental conditions. Moreover, in social animals, individual heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as functional for the group. Phenotypic plasticity can provide meaningful diversity \"for free\" based on early, local sensory experience, contributing toward better collective decision-making and resistance against adversarial agents, for example.

These specialized platforms are, in general, designed with swarming considerations at the front and center. Key hardware and software elements required for swarming are often deeply embedded and integrated with the particular system. However, given the noticeable increase in the number of low-cost mobile robots readily available, practitioners and hobbyists may start considering to assemble full-fledged swarms by minimally retrofitting such mobile platforms with a swarm-enabling technology. Here, we report one possible embodiment of such a technology-an integrated combination of hardware and software-designed to enable the assembly and the study of swarming in a range of general-purpose robotic systems. This is achieved by combining a modular and transferable software toolbox with a hardware suite composed of a collection of low-cost and off-theshelf components. The developed technology can be ported to a relatively vast range of robotic platforms-such as land and surface vehicles-with minimal changes and high levels of scalability. This swarm-enabling technology has successfully been implemented on two distinct distributed multi-robot systems, a swarm of mobile marine buoys and a team of commercial terrestrial robots. We have tested the effectiveness of both of these distributed robotic systems in performing collective exploration and search scenarios, as well as other classical cooperative behaviors. Experimental results on different swarm behaviors are reported for the two platforms in uncontrolled environments and without any supporting infrastructure. The design of the associated software library allows for a seamless switch to other cooperative behaviors-e.g., leader-follower heading consensus and collision avoidance, and also offers the possibility to simulate newly designed collective behaviors prior to their implementation onto the platforms.

Many real world applications, including environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, however, require scalable groups of robots to act jointly over large distances (e.g., 1,000 body lengths), rendering the use of dense swarms impractical. Using a dense swarm for such applications would be invasive to the environment and unrealistic in terms of mission deployment, maintenance and post-mission recovery.

We briefly introduce the concept of swarm grammars, an agent-based extension of L-systems for retracing growth processes and structural artifacts. Next, we review an early augmented reality prototype for designing and projecting biohybrid system simulations into real space. In addition to models that retrace plant behaviors, we specify swarm grammar agents to braid structures in a self-organizing manner. Based on this model, both robotic and plant-driven braiding processes can be experienced and explored in virtual worlds. We present an according user interface for use in virtual reality.

For a modeling framework to enable the design and analysis of such integrated intelligence, the underlying representations in the design of the robot should be dynamically sensitive, capable of reflecting both continuous motion and micro-cognitive influences, while also directly representing the necessary beliefs and intentions for goal-directed behavior. In this paper, a dynamical intention-based modeling framework is presented that satisfies these criteria, along with a hybrid dynamical cognitive agent (HDCA) framework for employing dynamical intentions in embodied agents. This dynamical intention-HDCA (DI-HDCA) modeling framework is a fusion of concepts from spreading activation networks, hybrid dynamical system models, and the BDI (belief-desire-intention) theory of goal-directed reasoning, adapted and employed unconventionally to meet entailments of environment and embodiment. The paper presents two kinds of autonomous agent learning results that demonstrate dynamical intentions and the multi-faceted integration they enable in embodied robots: with a simulated service robot in a grid-world office environment, reactive-level learning minimizes reliance on deliberative-level intelligence, enabling task sequencing and action selection to be distributed over both deliberative and reactive levels; and with a simulated game of Tag, the cognitive-physical integration of an autonomous agent enables the straightforward learning of a user-specified strategy during gameplay, without interruption to the game.

Getting beyond the centralized approach can increase the complexity of the embedded software, the sensitivity to the network topology, and render the deployment on physical devices tedious and error-prone. This work introduces a software-based solution to cope with these challenges on commercial hardware. We bring together our previous work on Buzz, the swarm-oriented programming language, and the many contributions of the Robotic Operating System (ROS) community into a reliable workflow, from rapid prototyping of decentralized behaviors up to robust field deployment. The Buzz programming language is a hardware independent, domain-specific (swarm-oriented), and composable language. From simulation to the field, a Buzz script can stay unmodified and almost seamlessly applicable to all units of a heterogeneous robotic team. We present the software structure of our solution, and the swarm-oriented paradigms it encompasses. While the design of a new behavior can be achieved on a lightweight simulator, we show how our security mechanisms enhance field deployment robustness. In addition, developers can update their scripts in the field using a safe software release mechanism.

To tackle this problem, it is possible (i) to act on the supply side, increasing the number of roads or lanes in a network, (ii) to reduce the demand, restricting the access to urban areas at specific hours or to specific vehicles, or (iii) to improve the efficiency of the existing network, by means of a widespread use of so-called Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In line with the recent advances in smart transportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising field of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, multiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and implementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby generating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms for the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the management of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous vehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact with the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the road network. Building on the reservationbased intersection control model proposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for the allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers' route choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["network","management","transportation","traffic","urban","road","infrastructure","problem","specific","vehicles"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if they can use -and even create -opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.In this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential optimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We present a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined) accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our formulations simultaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them to find solutions significantly faster (orders of magnitude faster in larger problems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["resources","phase","agents","optimal","phases","optimally","limitations","stochastic","create","using"],"revised_keywords":["Resource management","mission planning","multi-agent systems","stochastic optimization","mixed-integer programming","resource phasing"]}

Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system (i.e., agent society) is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, i.e., the complete system can be regarded as a single agent performing multimodal categorization using the sensors of all agents, if we define the rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence, i.e., forming and sharing signs and categories, is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the real-world environment. In the experiment, we compared three communication algorithms: no communication, no rejection, and the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher who would know a pre-existing symbol system.

Consensus as the most important issue in MAS, much progress has been made in studying the consensus control of MAS, but there are some problems remained largely unaddressed which cause the MAS to lose some useful network structure information. First, multi-agent consensus protocol usually proceeds over the low-order structure by only considering the direct edges between agents, but ignores the higher-order structure of the whole topology network. Second, the existing work assumes all the edges in a topology network have the same weight without exploring the potential diversity of the connections. In this way, multi-agent systems fail to enforce consensus, resulting in fragmentation into multiple clusters. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Motif-aware Weighted Multi-agent System (MWMS) method for consensus control. We focus more on triangle motif in the network, but it can be extended to other kinds of motifs as well. First, a novel weighted network is used which is the combination of the edge-based lower-order structure and the motif-based higher-order structure, i.e., hybrid-order structure. Subsequently, by simultaneously considering the quantity and the quality of the connections in the network, a novel consensus framework for MAS is designed to update agents. Then, two baseline consensus algorithms are used in MWMS. In our experiments, we use ten topologies of different shapes, densities and ranges to comprehensively analyze the performance of our proposed algorithms. The simulation results show that the hybrid higher-order network can effectively enhance the consensus of the multi-agent system in different network topologies.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["consensus","network","structure","mas","important","systems","control","first","considering","edges"],"revised_keywords":["1.

To evaluate the approach we apply multiagent-based simulation and model several scenarios of real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, a case study is conducted which covers the autonomous groupage traffic in the current processes of our industrial parter. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the sophisticated requirements of groupage traffic. Furthermore, the decision making supports the combination of pickup and delivery tours efficiently while satisfying logistic request priorities, time windows, and capacity constraints.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["groupage","traffic","processes","requirements","dispatching","decision","making","require","problem","orders"],"revised_keywords":["1.

The multi-robot system (MRS) is an important carrier for implementing an intelligent warehouse, which completes various tasks in the warehouse through cooperation and coordination between robots. As an extension of reinforcement learning and a kind of swarm intelligence, MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning) can effectively create the multi-robot systems in intelligent warehouses. However, MARL-based multi-robot systems in intelligent warehouses face serious safety issues, such as collisions, conflicts, and congestion. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a safe MARL method based on runtime verification, i.e., an optimized safety policy-generation framework, for multi-robot systems in intelligent warehouses. The framework consists of three stages. In the first stage, a runtime model SCMG (safety-constrained Markov Game) is defined for the multi-robot system at runtime in the intelligent warehouse. In the second stage, rPATL (probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with rewards) is used to express safety properties, and SCMG is cyclically verified and refined through runtime verification (RV) to ensure safety. This stage guarantees the safety of robots\u2019 behaviors before training. In the third stage, the verified SCMG guides SCPO (safety-constrained policy optimization) to obtain an optimized safety policy for robots. Finally, a multi-robot warehouse (RWARE) scenario is used for experimental evaluation.

Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if they can use -and even create -opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.In this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential optimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We present a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined) accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our formulations simultaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them to find solutions significantly faster (orders of magnitude faster in larger problems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["resources","phase","agents","optimal","phases","optimally","limitations","stochastic","create","using"],"revised_keywords":["1. **Resource-constrained planning:** This captures the core constraint driving the optimization.\n2. **Mission phasing:** This highlights the key technique used to address the constraint.\n3. **Stochastic optimization:** This accurately reflects the environmental uncertainty.\n4. **Multi-agent systems:** This specifies the scope of the problem beyond single agents.\n5. **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP):** This indicates the specific solution methodology.\n6. **Sequential decision making:** This describes the temporal aspect of the problem."]}

Methods: In this research paper, we propose a mixed-integer linear formulation for the DMS-p-MP, which captures the key features of the problem and allows for efficient solution methods. The DMS-p-MP adds two key features to the classical problem: (1) it considers the dynamic nature of the problem, where the demand is uncertain and changes over time, and (2) it allows for the modification of the facility locations over time, subject to a fixed number of modifications. The proposed model uses robust optimization in order to address the uncertainty of demand by allowing for the optimization of solutions that are not overly sensitive to small changes in the data or parameters. To manage the computational challenges presented by large-scale DMS-p-MP networks, a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is employed. Results: Our computational study in a real-life case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in solving the DMS p-Median Problem. The results show that the number of opened and closed buildings remains unchanged as the time horizon increases due to the periodic nature of our demand.

Reinforcement learning is expensive to train and often struggles to achieve coordination among a large fleet.

These techniques have garnered strong interest for the analysis of the large, multi-domain open science datasets that are increasingly available in health research. Discovery science in large datasets is challenging given the unconstrained nature of the learning environment where there may be a large number of potential predictors and appropriate ranges for model hyperparameters are unknown. As well, it is likely that explainability is at a premium in order to engage in future hypothesis generation or analysis. Here, we present a novel method that addresses these challenges by exploiting evolutionary algorithms to optimize machine learning discovery science while exploring a large solution space and minimizing bias. We demonstrate that our approach, called integrated evolutionary learning (IEL), provides an automated, adaptive method for jointly learning features and hyperparameters while furnishing explainable models where the original features used to make predictions may be obtained even with artificial neural networks. In IEL the machine learning algorithm of choice is nested inside an evolutionary algorithm which selects features and hyperparameters over generations on the basis of an information function to converge on an optimal solution. We apply IEL to three gold standard machine learning algorithms in challenging, heterogenous biobehavioral data: deep learning with artificial neural networks, decision tree-based techniques and baseline linear models. Using our novel IEL approach, artificial neural networks achieved \u2265 95% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity and 45\u201373% R2 in classification and substantial gains over default settings.

Our objective is to reduce the inference latency of the solution while admissibly maintaining the vision transformer\u2019s performance. Thus, we employed the optimal cloud components as the foundation of our machine learning pipeline and optimized the topology of vision transformers. We utilized UCF101, including more than one million action recognition video clips. The modeling pipeline consists of a preprocessing module to extract frames from video clips, training two-dimensional (2D) vision transformer models, and deep learning baselines. The pipeline also includes a postprocessing step to aggregate the frame-level predictions to generate the video-level predictions at inference. The results demonstrate that our optimal vision transformer model with an input dimension of 56 \u00d7 56 \u00d7 3 with eight attention heads produces an F1 score of 91.497% for the testing set. The optimized vision transformer reduces the inference latency by 40.70%, measured through a batch-processing approach, with a 55.63% faster training time than the baseline. Lastly, we developed an enhanced skip-frame approach to improve the inference latency by finding an optimal ratio of frames for prediction at inference, where we could further reduce the inference latency by 57.15%.

Recently, data-driven predictions have attracted interest in high-stakes decision-making. Despite this, advanced AI methods are less often used for such tasks. This is because AI technology is a black box for the social systems it is meant to support; trustworthiness and fairness have not yet been established. Meanwhile in the field of marketing, strategic decision-making is a high-stakes problem that has a significant impact on business trends. For global marketing, with its diverse cultures and market environments, future decision-making is likely to focus on building consensus on the formulation of the problem itself rather than on solutions for achieving the goal. There are two important and conflicting facts: the fact that the core of domestic strategic decision-making comes down to the formulation of the problem itself, and the fact that it is difficult to realize AI technology that can achieve problem formulation. How can we resolve this difficulty with current technology? This is the main challenge for the realization of high-level human-AI systems in the marketing field. Thus, we propose customer journey mapping (CJM) automation through model-level data fusion, a process for the practical problem formulation known as explainable alignment. Using domain-specific requirements and observations as inputs, the system automatically outputs a CJM. Explainable alignment corresponds with both human and AI perspectives and in formulating the problem, thereby improving strategic decision-making in marketing. Following preprocessing to make latent variables and their dynamics transparent with latent Dirichlet allocation and a variational autoencoder, a post-hoc explanation is implemented in which a hidden Markov model and learning from an interpretation transition are combined with a long short-term memory architecture that learns sequential data between touchpoints for extracting attitude rules for CJM.

Blockchain is a digital transformation technology that is not fully conceptualized with respect to supply chain implementation and the related strategy formulation, particularly in the context of sustainability. Furthermore, the integration of consumers into the CE remains not well understood or researched, with the main focus of CE being the cycling of resources. Methods: This research employs a qualitative case study methodology of the first coffee business in the USA to use blockchain technology as an exemplar.

We consider an entrepreneur who uses outside financing and exerts private effort to build a platform and users who decide whether to join in response to the platform\u2019s dynamic transaction fee policy. We first show that raising capital by issuing tokens rather than equity mitigates effort under-provision because the payoff to equity investors depends on profit, whereas the payoff to token investors depends on transaction volume, which is less sensitive to effort. Second, we show that decentralized governance associated with tokenization eliminates a potential holdup of platform users, which in turn alleviates the need to provide users with incentives to join, reducing the entrepreneur\u2019s financing burden. The downside of tokenization is that it puts a cap on how much capital the entrepreneur can raise. Namely, if tokens are highly liquid, that is, they change hands many times per unit of time, their market capitalization is small relative to the net present value (NPV) of the platform profits, limiting how much money one can raise by issuing tokens rather than equity. If building the platform is expensive, this can distort the capacity investment. The resulting tradeoff between the benefits and costs of tokenization leads to several predictions regarding adoption.

This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI\u2019s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5\u00d7 semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students.

Due to their humanlike appearance, humanoid robots might be capable of evoking the intentional stance.

The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential.

In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers\u2019 influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 decisions. When taking into account retailers\u2019 buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer\u2019s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices. Conclusions: We found that FTAs would not cause carbon leakage directly and would be effective for reducing GHG emissions economically.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["carbon","ghg","emissions","ftas","global","supply","tax","chain","costs","prices"],"revised_keywords":["1.

A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios allows organizational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA\u2019s accuracy. The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers and managers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["rpa","adoption","potential","barriers","process","beef","model","supply","chain","allows"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Ecological embeddedness is a subset of the circular economy (CE) that demands legitimacy through design changes to product, production and\/or packaging for benefits to economic actors and the environment. This is in contrast with legitimacy as a public relations exercise. Blockchain is a digital transformation technology that is not fully conceptualized with respect to supply chain implementation and the related strategy formulation, particularly in the context of sustainability. Furthermore, the integration of consumers into the CE remains not well understood or researched, with the main focus of CE being the cycling of resources. Methods: This research employs a qualitative case study methodology of the first coffee business in the USA to use blockchain technology as an exemplar. Gap analysis is then applied to identify how blockchain could be used to advance from the current state to a more sustainable one. Results: Findings indicate that the implementation of blockchain is not ecologically embedded in the example studied.

With the unprecedented development of the information technology today, the industrial data collected could assist in the in-depth study on green manufacturing, which ranges from the operations of machining tools all the way to supply chain management. The wide scope of research promises a tremendous amount of annual publications in this field. To better facilitate follow-up research work, the present study provides a systematic overview of green manufacturing-related areas, including research progress and the developed features. The article set retrieved from the Web of Science contains 5989 documents related to green manufacturing. It is revealed that Journal of Cleaner Production is the most productive journal, archiving documents within the scope of green manufacturing. P. R. China tops the list of the number of documents with 1357 documents (22.66%), while Zhejiang University is the most productive institution. As the cooperation network indicates, P. R. China and the United States maintain the strongest collaborative links with other countries\/regions. Finally, possible future directions are recommended based on the findings in the study. For instance, additive manufacturing technology and industrial IoT both have a great potential in green manufacturing; the weak link between the disciplines of manufacturing engineering and environmental science is expected to be strengthened, and a stronger international cooperation is believed to be beneficial to the field for the otherwise isolated countries\/regions.\nK E Y W O R D S bibliometric analysis, energy efficient, energy saving, green manufacturing, green production, sustainable manufacturingThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["manufacturing","green","documents","energy","study","research","saving","sustainable","development","technology"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Costs, GHG emissions, and carbon tax prices differ in each country due to economic conditions, energy mixes, and government policies. Additionally, multiple countries have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices.

The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed.","source_file":"1.2.2.6 LR - Agents.csv","extracted_keywords":["supply","chain","risks","may","companies","total","costs","pandemic","disruptions","managers"],"revised_keywords":["1.

Research in the broad area of ECLO encompasses a wide range of topics including sustainable supply chain, green supply chain, closed-loop supply chain, low-carbon logistics, and waste management. In this paper, a comprehensive content analysis and area review is presented. Over 800 papers published between 1994 and 2017 in peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters are utilized. These papers are analyzed in consecutive stages after being reviewed under a structural dimension process that addresses the fields of environmentally concerned logistics operations. Following the state-of-the-art review, a detailed analysis of ECLO research with a special emphasis on fuzzy applications is provided. The findings clearly indicate that the fuzzy multi-criteria decision making technique is a frequently used hybrid method, whereas fuzzy sets theory and other fuzzy hybrid techniques identify a gap in the related literature.

The reason behind this gap is closely linked to the involvement of a large number of participants with conflicting interests in the process. This complexity explains why modelling an optimization tool for maritime logistics services appears challenging. Although new technologies such as blockchains and smart contracts have helped reduce the number of participants and address some complexities, they cannot fully resolve the fragmentation observed in maritime transport.\n               To address the need for optimized voyage management for vessels, this study takes a holistic approach to voyage costs within the maritime supply chain, similar to how a single company would approach it. The study combines a case study from the container shipping industry, expert interviews, project results, and secondary empirical data research to develop a financial model for optimizing voyage costs.

First, relevance of this model in game theoretic contexts like Prisoners\u2019 dilemma and collusion is presented. Next, a generic multi-agent framework for simulating dilemmas around responsible agency is also proposed. CT implemented on this framework, is shown to be versatile in acting responsibly to different kinds of circumstances\u2013including modifying their strategy based on their interaction with other agents in the system as well as interacting with adversaries that are rational maximizers, and who have a rationale to exploit responsible behavior from other agents. CT is also shown to outperform reciprocity as a strategy for responsible autonomy. Thus, we present CT as a framework for building autonomous agents which can intrinsically act responsibly in multi-agent systems.

By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives\u2019 trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their \u201cnetwork trust\u201d) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives\u2019 professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives\u2019 trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain.
