# Dashboard Feature

This dashboard is built using Flask and provides a visual interface for real-time insights into the projectâ€™s data. It aggregates and displays:

- Daily download counts and processing statistics.
- Analysis results from clustering and reference metrics.
- Additional key performance indicators relevant to the project.

## Running the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:

   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   ```

2. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to view the dashboard.

Future enhancements will add interactive charts and additional features.
