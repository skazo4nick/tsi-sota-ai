# Project Context - Knowledge Retrieval Agentic System
project_name: "Knowledge Retrieval Agentic System"
project_goal: "To design, build, evaluate, and iteratively improve a Knowledge Retrieval Agentic System, leveraging Large Language Models, agent networks, and multiple storage solutions for comprehensive information retrieval and research capabilities."
project_description: "This project involves developing a system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agent networks to enhance knowledge retrieval and research capabilities. The system integrates multiple storage solutions (Backblaze B2, Qdrant, Meilisearch) and knowledge representation techniques (Knowledge Graph with Neo4j) to provide comprehensive information retrieval and research capabilities. The goal is to create a practical and valuable tool for researchers, knowledge workers, and anyone needing to discover and analyze information from multiple sources."
project_structure: "The project repository is organized into 'data/' (for datasets), 'app/' (for Python source code), 'notebooks/' (for exploratory analysis and prototyping), 'memory_bank/' (for documentation and architectural decisions), and 'springernature_api_client/' (for API implementations)."
key_features_to_build:
  - "Implement a multi-source content retrieval system with API integrations (SpringerNature, CORE)"
  - "Develop a semantic search capability using Qdrant vector storage"
  - "Build a Knowledge Graph using Neo4j for relationship discovery and complex querying"
  - "Create a context-aware retrieval system with hierarchical context management"
  - "Implement agent-based workflows using smolagents for orchestrated research and analysis"
  - "Design an interactive dashboard for system insights and data exploration"
