# Discussion Protocol: Vector Memory Architecture Decision
**Date:** 2024-03-21
**Participants:** AI Assistant, Project Team
**Topic:** Vector-based Shared Memory Architecture Decision

## Context
The project involves a multi-agent research application based on LangGraph and CrewAI, with multiple storage layers including object storage, vector database (Qdrant), and full-text search (Meilisearch). The system retrieves research publications from various APIs (Arxiv, Semantic Scholar, CORE, Open Alex) and processes them through a network of agents.

## Discussion Points

### Initial Proposal
- Considered implementing vector-based shared memory for agent communication
- Potential benefits:
  - Increased communication speed
  - Enhanced text analysis capabilities
  - More efficient information processing

### Research Findings
- Analyzed two key research documents:
  1. `/body_of_knowledge/vector_communication_architecture.md`
  2. `/body_of_knowledge/vector_semantic_drift.md`

Key findings from research:
- Semantic drift presents significant challenges in cross-LLM communication
- Different embedding spaces require complex alignment techniques
- Maintaining semantic consistency across different LLMs is resource-intensive
- Monitoring and managing drift requires significant overhead

### Decision
After thorough analysis, the team decided to:
1. Step back from vector-based shared memory implementation
2. Maintain text-based communication for multi-agent interaction
3. Continue using Qdrant Cloud (free tier) for document storage and retrieval
4. Focus on multi-LLM architecture for:
   - Cost optimization
   - Provider resilience
   - Bias reduction
   - Diverse analysis capabilities

### Additional Considerations
The discussion also identified potential enhancements to the agent system:
1. **Image Analysis Agent**
   - Purpose: Analyze scientific visualizations, graphs, and diagrams
   - Potential models: CLIP, LayoutLM, specialized scientific diagram models
   - Benefits: Enhanced understanding of visual research content

2. **Table Analysis Agent**
   - Purpose: Process and analyze tabular data from research papers
   - Implementation: Pandas-based agent
   - Capabilities:
     - Data extraction
     - Statistical analysis
     - Insight generation
     - Visualization creation

## Action Items
1. Maintain current text-based communication architecture
2. Implement Qdrant Cloud integration for document storage
3. Plan development of image and table analysis agents
4. Document agent communication protocols
5. Establish monitoring system for multi-LLM performance

2. Semantic Drift Research: `/body_of_knowledge/vector_semantic_drift.md`

## Next Steps
1. Review and finalize agent communication protocols
2. Design image and table analysis agent specifications
3. Plan integration of new agents into existing architecture
4. Schedule follow-up discussion for implementation details
