# Project Backlog and Publication Selection Criteria

## Publication Selection Mechanism

### Quality Assessment Criteria

1. **Content Relevance**
   - Semantic similarity of abstract to research topic
   - Keyword alignment with research domain
   - Topic coverage and depth
   - Methodology relevance

2. **Publication Quality**
   - Journal/Conference Impact Factor
   - Journal Quartile (Q1-Q4)
   - Conference Ranking (A*, A, B, C)
   - Acceptance Rate
   - Citation Count
   - H-index of the journal/conference

3. **Author Credibility**
   - Author's H-index
   - Author's publication history in the domain
   - Author's institutional affiliation
   - Author's citation count
   - Author's recent activity in the field

4. **Research Impact**
   - Number of citations
   - Citation velocity (citations per year)
   - Altmetrics score
   - Social media mentions
   - Industry adoption

5. **Methodological Quality**
   - Research design rigor
   - Sample size and representativeness
   - Statistical analysis quality
   - Reproducibility indicators
   - Open data availability

6. **Temporal Relevance**
   - Publication year
   - Citation age distribution
   - Field development stage
   - Technology maturity

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Data Sources**
   - CrossRef API for metadata
   - Scopus API for citation metrics
   - Google Scholar API for broader metrics
   - Journal/Conference ranking databases
   - Author profile databases

2. **Scoring System**
   - Weighted scoring for each criterion
   - Normalization of different metrics
   - Threshold-based filtering
   - Dynamic weight adjustment based on research domain

3. **Integration Points**
   - API Integration Layer
   - Knowledge Graph Layer
   - Storage Layer
   - Context Management Layer
