### Requirements and Planning

**Project Requirements & Stakeholder Needs:**  
- Gather articles and PDFs related to relevant research and commercial content.  
- Enable a system for parsing, analyzing, and clustering the downloaded content.  
- Provide reproducible computational analysis via interactive notebooks.  
- Ensure documentation supports both developers and end-users.

**Roadmap & Milestones:**  
- Define scope and gather initial requirements.  
- Design system architecture and data flows.  
- Develop modules: downloading, parsing, and data analysis.  
- Integrate interactive notebooks for analytics.  
- Conduct testing, deployment, and user feedback sessions.

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**  
- Data variability: plan for multiple formats and error handling.  
- Scalability: design with modularity and future extensions in mind.  
- Reproducibility: ensure environments and dependencies are clearly documented.
