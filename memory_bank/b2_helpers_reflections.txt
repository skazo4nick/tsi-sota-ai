B2 Helpers Enhancements - Reflections and Findings
==================================================

File Size Validation:
---------------------
- The upload_file_to_b2 function implements a file size check that rejects files exceeding 100MB.
- This validation is designed to prevent large file uploads, reducing potential resource strain and ensuring smoother upload operations.

Testing Enhancements:
---------------------
- There is a need to develop new tests focused on the file size validation to confirm that oversized files are properly rejected.
- Future tests should also verify the enhanced error handling implemented across the B2 helper functions.
- Consideration for JSON handling tests is noted, in case further processing of JSON responses is implemented.

Error Handling Improvements:
----------------------------
- Enhanced error messaging and consistent logging have been implemented in the helper functions.
- These improvements provide clearer context for failures, facilitating better debugging and maintainability of the code.

Future Enhancements:
--------------------
- Potential improvements include creating dedicated JSON parsing and formatting helpers for file metadata.
- There is an opportunity to simulate more robust error scenarios in tests, further strengthening the reliability of the system.

Action Items:
-------------
- This document serves as a reference guide for the reflection on recent updates.
- Use these insights to guide future developments and further testing enhancements for B2 helper functions.
