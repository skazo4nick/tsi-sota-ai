# Lessons Learned

## 1. Backblaze B2 Integration (2025-02-27)

### Objective
• Establish a reliable connection to Backblaze B2 for storing and retrieving project PDFs

### Issues Encountered with boto3 Approach
• Persistent invalid endpoint errors due to differences between S3‐compatible behavior and Backblaze B2 implementation
• Multiple configuration attempts failed despite:
  - Adjusting signature version to "s3v4"
  - Trying different region parameters
  - Appending bucket name to endpoint URL
• Code preserved in app/test_boto3_b2_connection.py for reference

### Decision & Solution
• Switched from boto3 to native Backblaze B2 SDK (b2sdk)
• Implemented clean test script in app/test_b2sdk_connection.py
• Resolved version-specific issues (e.g., removed deprecated show_versions parameter)

### Key Takeaways
• For B2 integration, prefer official b2sdk over boto3
• Document failed approaches to prevent future repetition
• Keep test scripts for both approaches for reference
