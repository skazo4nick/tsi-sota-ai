Existing Lessons Learned:
--------------------------------
[Previous lessons learned are preserved here.]

-- Restored Lessons Learned from b2 Library --
- In earlier work with the b2 library, it was discovered that proper configuration of API keys and credentials is crucial for establishing successful connections.
- It was also noted that the b2 library requires robust error handling, as connection and API errors need to be caught and logged for effective troubleshooting.

--- New Lessons Learned on 2025-03-05 ---
- Verified that basic print statements function correctly (using tests/test_print.py).
- Identified import and PYTHONPATH issues in the dev container; resolved by modifying the test run command to: 
  PYTHONPATH=/workspaces/tsi-sota-ai python -m tests.test_full_download_cycle
- Confirmed that the full download cycle script processes DOIs and correctly handles cases where the Springer Nature API does not return an XML full text.
- Enhanced debugging and error handling by adding delays (time.sleep), flush=True in print statements, and wrapping API calls in try/except blocks.
- Always append new lessons learned; do not erase previous lessons.
