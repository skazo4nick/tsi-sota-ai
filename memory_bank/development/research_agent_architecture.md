# Research Agent Architecture

## Overview
This document serves as the main navigation point for the Research Assistant's architecture documentation. It provides an overview of the system and links to detailed documentation in specialized subfiles.

## Version Information
- Version: 1.0.0
- Last Updated: 2024-04-28
- Status: Active Development

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Agent System
The Research Assistant employs a multi-agent system with specialized agents for different research tasks. For detailed information about agent roles, capabilities, and communication patterns, see:
- [Agent System Documentation](agent_system.md)

### 2. Workflow Orchestration
The system uses LangGraph and CrewAI for workflow orchestration. For implementation details and best practices, see:
- [Workflow Orchestration](workflow_orchestration.md)

### 3. State Management
The system maintains complex state across different components. For state management architecture and implementation details, see:
- [State Management System](state_management.md)

### 4. Memory Architecture
The system implements a sophisticated memory system with different types and management strategies. For detailed information, see:
- [Memory Architecture](memory_architecture.md)

### 5. Multi-LLM Architecture
The system uses multiple LLMs with different configurations and strategies. For implementation details, see:
- [Multi-LLM Architecture](multi_llm_architecture.md)

### 6. Request Processing
The system includes intelligent request analysis and routing. For implementation details, see:
- [Request Processing System](request_processing.md)

### 7. Storage Architecture
The system implements a hybrid cloud architecture for data storage. For implementation details, see:
- [Storage Architecture](storage_architecture.md)
