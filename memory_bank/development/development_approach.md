# Development Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the development approach for the Knowledge Retrieval Agentic System. It describes our strategy, key development steps, and overall methodology for building the system.

## Development Strategy

We will use a **hybrid approach** that combines both top-down and bottom-up development strategies:

1. **Start with the architecture and core interfaces** (top-down)
   - Define the overall system architecture
   - Design interfaces between components
   - Establish data flow patterns
   - Create abstract base classes for key components

2. **Implement core modules in parallel** (bottom-up)
   - Develop storage integrations (B2, Qdrant, Meilisearch)
   - Build API clients (SpringerNature, CORE)
   - Create knowledge graph foundation

3. **Integrate components incrementally** (middle-out)
   - Connect storage layers to API clients
   - Link knowledge graph to storage layers
   - Implement context management

4. **Develop orchestration framework** (top-down)
   - Design agent interfaces
   - Implement workflow definitions
   - Create agent communication patterns

This approach allows us to:
- Establish a solid foundation early
- Validate core components independently
- Identify integration challenges early
- Maintain flexibility as requirements evolve

## Key Development Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Set up project structure
- Implement base API client interface
- Create storage layer abstractions
- Design knowledge graph schema
- Establish context management structure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (3-4 weeks)
- Implement SpringerNature and CORE API clients
- Develop B2, Qdrant, and Meilisearch integrations
- Create Neo4j knowledge graph implementation
- Build context management system

### Phase 3: Integration (2-3 weeks)
- Connect API clients to storage layers
- Link storage layers to knowledge graph
- Implement context-aware retrieval
- Develop semantic search capabilities

### Phase 4: Orchestration (2-3 weeks)
- Design and implement agent framework
- Create workflow definitions
- Develop agent communication patterns
- Build orchestration layer

### Phase 5: Interface and Testing (2-3 weeks)
- Develop retrieval interface
- Create dashboard for system insights
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance

## Development Standards

### Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Implement comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility

### Architecture Standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement dependency injection where appropriate
- Use interfaces for component boundaries
- Maintain loose coupling between modules
- Design for testability

### Testing Standards
- Write unit tests for all modules (aim for 80%+ coverage)
- Implement integration tests for component interactions
- Create end-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update documentation with code changes
- Use consistent terminology across documentation
- Include examples in documentation
- Document design decisions and rationale

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning**
   - Define requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Break down tasks into manageable units
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set priorities and deadlines

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow coding standards
   - Write tests alongside code
   - Document as you go
   - Regular code reviews

3. **Testing**
   - Unit testing during development
   - Integration testing after component completion
   - End-to-end testing for critical workflows
   - Performance testing for optimization

4. **Review and Refinement**
   - Code reviews for quality assurance
   - Architecture reviews for system integrity
   - Performance reviews for optimization
   - Documentation reviews for completeness

5. **Deployment**
   - Staging deployment for testing
   - Production deployment with monitoring
   - Post-deployment verification
   - Feedback collection and incorporation

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
- Integration challenges between components
- Performance issues with large datasets
- API limitations or changes
- Scalability concerns with knowledge graph

### Mitigation Strategies
- Early prototyping of integration points
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- Abstraction layers for API clients
- Scalability testing and optimization

## Success Criteria

- All core components implemented and integrated
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Performance meets requirements
- User interface is intuitive and effective
