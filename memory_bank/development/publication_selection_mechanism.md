        self.graph = Graph()
        self.setup_workflow()
        
    def setup_workflow(self):

        """
        Update selection criteria weights based on expert feedback
        and historical performance
        """
        for criterion, adjustment in feedback.items():
            historical_trend = self.analyze_feedback_history(criterion)
            self.weights[criterion] += self.learning_rate * (
                adjustment + historical_trend
            )
            
    def adjust_thresholds(self, performance_metrics: dict):
        """
        Dynamically adjust selection thresholds based on performance
        and domain evolution
        """
        domain_velocity = self.calculate_domain_velocity()
        
        if performance_metrics['precision'] < 0.8:
            self.min_quality_score += 0.05 * domain_velocity
        if performance_metrics['recall'] < 0.7:
            self.min_relevance_score -= 0.05 * domain_velocity
            
    def analyze_feedback_history(self, criterion: str) -> float:
        """
        Analyze historical feedback to identify trends
        """
        recent_feedback = self.feedback_history[-10:]
        return sum(f[criterion] for f in recent_feedback) / len(recent_feedback)
        
    def calculate_domain_velocity(self) -> float:
        """
        Calculate the rate of change in the research domain
        """

        return 1.0  # Placeholder
```

## Integration with Knowledge Graph

### 1. Data Model

    title: $title,
    quality_score: $quality_score,
    relevance_score: $relevance_score,
    selection_date: $selection_date,
    domain_velocity: $domain_velocity,
    feedback_history: $feedback_history
})

// Relationships with Temporal Context
CREATE (p)-[:SELECTED_FOR {
    timestamp: $timestamp,
    selection_criteria: $criteria
}]->(r:ResearchQuestion {
    id: $research_question_id
})
```

### 2. Query Patterns
```cypher
// Find highly relevant papers with dynamic thresholds
MATCH (p:Publication)-[s:SELECTED_FOR]->(r:ResearchQuestion {id: $id})
WHERE p.quality_score >= $dynamic_quality_threshold 
  AND p.relevance_score >= $dynamic_relevance_threshold
  AND s.timestamp > datetime() - duration('P1Y')
RETURN p
ORDER BY (p.quality_score + p.relevance_score)/2 DESC
```
