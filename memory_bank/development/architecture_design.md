## Component Interactions

### 1. Query Processing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>API Gateway: Submit Query
    API Gateway->>Agent Orchestration: Route Request
    Agent Orchestration->>Knowledge Graph: Process Query
    Knowledge Graph->>Storage Layer: Retrieve Data
    Storage Layer-->>Knowledge Graph: Return Results
    Knowledge Graph-->>Agent Orchestration: Process Results
    Agent Orchestration-->>API Gateway: Format Response
    API Gateway-->>Client: Return Response
```

### 2. Data Ingestion Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>API Gateway: Submit Document
    API Gateway->>Agent Orchestration: Route Request
    Agent Orchestration->>Storage Layer: Store Document
    Storage Layer->>Knowledge Graph: Extract Knowledge
    Knowledge Graph->>Context Management: Update Context
    Context Management-->>Agent Orchestration: Confirm Update
    Agent Orchestration-->>API Gateway: Return Status
    API Gateway-->>Client: Confirm Ingestion
```

## Data Flow

### 1. Knowledge Representation
```python
class KnowledgeNode:
    """Represents a node in the knowledge graph"""
    id: str
    type: str
    properties: Dict[str, Any]
    embeddings: List[float]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]

class KnowledgeRelationship:
    """Represents a relationship in the knowledge graph"""
    source_id: str
    target_id: str
    type: str
    properties: Dict[str, Any]
    confidence: float
```

### 2. Context Management
```python
class Context:
    """Manages context for operations"""
    session_id: str
    user_id: str
    context_data: Dict[str, Any]
    version: int
    timestamp: datetime
```

## Performance Requirements

### 1. Response Times
- API Gateway: < 100ms
- Knowledge Graph Queries: < 500ms
- Document Processing: < 2s
- Context Retrieval: < 200ms

### 2. Throughput
- API Requests: 1000 requests/second
- Document Ingestion: 100 documents/minute
- Graph Updates: 1000 nodes/second

### 3. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for all components
- Load balancing at API Gateway
- Caching at multiple levels

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication
