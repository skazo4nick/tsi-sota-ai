# Research Methodology Best Practices

## Research Question Formulation

### Characteristics of Good Research Questions (FINERMAPS)
1. **Feasible**
   - Adequate number of subjects
   - Adequate technical expertise
   - Affordable in time and money
   - Manageable in scope

2. **Interesting**
   - Gets investigator excited
   - Relevant to scientific community
   - Addresses knowledge gaps

3. **Novel**
   - Confirms or refutes previous findings
   - Provides new findings
   - Extends previous findings

4. **Ethical**
   - Respects participant rights
   - Minimizes risks
   - Maximizes benefits

5. **Relevant**
   - Advances scientific knowledge
   - Influences clinical practice
   - Informs health policy

6. **Manageable**
   - Clear scope and boundaries
   - Appropriate complexity
   - Achievable within constraints

7. **Appropriate**
   - Matches research goals
   - Aligns with methodology
   - Fits available resources

8. **Potential Value**
   - Addresses significant problem
   - Has practical applications
   - Contributes to field

9. **Systematic**
   - Follows logical structure
   - Uses consistent methodology
   - Produces reproducible results

### Question Formulation Process
1. **Identify Research Area**
   - Review existing literature
   - Identify knowledge gaps
   - Consider practical implications

2. **Narrow Focus**
   - Define specific population
   - Specify intervention/exposure
   - Determine outcome measures

3. **Structure Question**
   - Use PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
   - Include temporal aspects
   - Specify context

4. **Evaluate Question**
   - Check against FINERMAPS criteria
   - Assess feasibility
   - Consider ethical implications

## Deep Research Methodology

### Best Practices for Perplexity Deep Research
1. **Question Structure**
   - Start with clear objective
   - Include context and scope
   - Specify desired outcome type

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Use specific terminology
   - Include relevant timeframes
   - Add domain-specific constraints

3. **Result Analysis**
   - Cross-reference multiple sources
   - Evaluate source credibility
   - Synthesize findings

### Example Research Questions
1. **Technology Implementation**
   - "What are the current best practices for implementing Neo4j in large-scale knowledge graphs, focusing on performance optimization and scalability?"
   - "How do leading organizations structure their knowledge graph schemas for academic research and citation networks?"

2. **Methodology**
   - "What are the most effective strategies for maintaining data quality in evolving knowledge graphs?"
   - "How do modern research platforms handle concept relationship management and evolution tracking?"

3. **Performance**
   - "What are the latest techniques for optimizing Neo4j query performance in citation network analysis?"
   - "How do large-scale knowledge graphs implement efficient concept relationship traversal?"
