# Development Status Report: Keyword Analysis Notebooks for "Agent" Research Dynamics

## Overview

The project aims to deliver a robust, modular keyword analysis pipeline to collect, process, and analyze research publications related to "agent" and "agentic AI" in Supply Chain Management (SCM). The solution will enable researchers to track the evolution, frequency, and thematic trends of agent-related research using automated data acquisition, NLP, semantic analysis, and visualization.

## Current Status

- **API Integration:** Nearly complete coverage for major academic APIs (Semantic Scholar, CORE, OpenAlex, arXiv). Proven, production-ready clients are in place.
- **Data Processing:** Standardized, modular data processing and configuration management are implemented, supporting YAML-based configs and consistent DataFrame outputs.
- **Analysis Patterns:** Existing notebooks already demonstrate keyword extraction, clustering, and visualization workflows, providing a strong foundation for further development.
- **Technical Stack:** All core libraries are in use; additional NLP and embedding libraries (sentence-transformers, umap-learn, yake) are planned for advanced features.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Programmatically fetch publication metadata from multiple APIs using configurable, domain-specific queries (e.g., "agent", "LLM", "Supply Chain Management").
   - Support Boolean operators and flexible timeframes for historical and recent trend analysis.
   - Store raw data for reproducibility and efficiency.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardize and clean metadata from all sources.
   - Consolidate into unified DataFrames for downstream analysis.

3. **Keyword Analysis**
   - Extract keywords provided by APIs and apply NLP-based extraction (TF-IDF, RAKE, YAKE) to abstracts.
   - Analyze keyword frequency and temporal distribution to identify research focus shifts.

4. **Semantic Analysis**
   - Generate embeddings for abstracts using BGE-M3 or similar models.
   - Perform clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify thematic groups and track their evolution.

5. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Produce temporal trend plots, cluster visualizations, and thematic evolution diagrams.
   - Export results as images and structured data for reporting and further analysis.

6. **Notebook Integration**
   - Develop comprehensive, interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the full pipeline.
   - Provide clear usage examples, configuration options, and visual outputs for researchers.

## Next Steps

- Finalize integration of advanced NLP and embedding libraries.
- Enhance and document the main analysis notebook for "agent" research dynamics.
- Validate the pipeline with real-world queries and datasets.
- Prepare user-facing documentation and usage guides.

## Conclusion

The project is well-aligned with requirements and leverages a strong technical foundation. The planned enhancements will enable comprehensive, reproducible analysis of agent-related research trends, supporting both interactive exploration and automated reporting for the SLR.
