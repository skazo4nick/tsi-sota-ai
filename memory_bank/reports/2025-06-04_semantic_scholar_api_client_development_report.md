## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

The Semantic Scholar API client follows the established `BaseAPIClient` pattern used throughout the TSI-SOTA-AI system:

```
SemanticScholarAPIClient (BaseAPIClient)
├── Core Search Methods
│   ├── fetch_publications() - Main search with pagination
│   ├── fetch_bulk_publications() - Bulk search by paper IDs
│   └── search_papers_advanced() - Advanced filtered search
├── Detailed Retrieval Methods
│   ├── get_paper_details() - Individual paper metadata
│   ├── get_paper_citations() - Citation network data
│   └── get_paper_references() - Reference network data
├── Author Methods
│   └── search_authors() - Author search functionality
└── Infrastructure
    ├── Rate limiting (100 req/5min)
    ├── Error handling and retries
    └── Data normalization
```

### 3.2 Key Features Implemented

### 3.3 Rate Limiting and Performance

```python
Rate Limiting Strategy:
- Free Tier: 100 requests per 5-minute window

- Graceful waiting when limits are reached
- Configurable rate limiting parameters
```

### 3.4 Data Standardization

All API responses are normalized to the standard TSI-SOTA-AI format:

```python
Standardized Output Format:
{
    "doi": str,
    "title": str,
    "abstract": str,
    "authors": List[str],
    "publication_date": str,
    "keywords": List[str],
    "citation_count": int,
    "reference_count": int,
    "url": str,
    "venue": str,
    "external_ids": Dict,
    "source": "Semantic Scholar"
}
```

## 4. Integration Details

### 4.1 DataAcquirer Integration

The Semantic Scholar client has been successfully integrated into the existing data acquisition pipeline:

**Files Modified:**
- `/workspaces/tsi-sota-ai/slr_core/api_clients.py` - Added SemanticScholarAPIClient class (561 lines)
- `/workspaces/tsi-sota-ai/slr_core/data_acquirer.py` - Updated SUPPORTED_SOURCES and client initialization
- `/workspaces/tsi-sota-ai/config/slr_config.yaml` - Added semantic_scholar API configuration

**Integration Points:**
```python
# DataAcquirer.SUPPORTED_SOURCES now includes:
SUPPORTED_SOURCES = [
    "Core",
    "Arxiv", 
    "OpenAlex",
    "SemanticScholar"  # ✅ Added
]

# Client initialization:
self.clients = {
    "Core": CoreAPIClient(config_manager),
    "Arxiv": ArxivAPIClient(config_manager),
    "OpenAlex": OpenAlexAPIClient(config_manager),
    "SemanticScholar": SemanticScholarAPIClient(config_manager)  # ✅ Added
}
```

### 4.2 Configuration Management

Configuration follows the established ConfigManager pattern:

```yaml
# config/slr_config.yaml
api_settings:
  semantic_scholar:
    base_url: "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/"
    recommendations_url: "https://api.semanticscholar.org/recommendations/v1/"
    user_agent: "tsi-sota-ai/1.0 (research@example.com)"
```
