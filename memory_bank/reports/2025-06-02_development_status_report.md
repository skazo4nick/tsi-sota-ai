# Development Status Report

**Date:** 2025-06-02

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the current status and next steps for external publication API integrations in the repository, focusing on the recent CORE API module refactor and the planned OpenAlex/pyalex integration.

---

## 2. CORE API Module Update

- The `core_api_client.py` module was refactored for full endpoint coverage and robust search capabilities.
- Key improvements:
  - Added/updated search functions: `search_works_by_keyword`, `search_works_by_doi`, `search_works_by_title`, `search_works_by_author`, and `search_works_by_field`.
  - Updated entity retrieval functions to use correct endpoints and support all subresources.
  - Improved error handling and type checks throughout the module.
  - Validated that new search functions return correct results.
- All major CORE API endpoints are now supported, including `/works/{id}`, `/works/{id}/outputs`, `/works/{id}/stats`, `/works/tei/{id}`, and `/works/{id}/download`.
- B2 integration tests passed; CORE API tests now pass with the updated module.

## 3. OpenAlex/pyalex Integration Plan

- The current OpenAlex client is a basic, direct HTTP implementation with limited coverage (see `openaalex_customclass_report.md`).
- Plan:
  1. Draft and commit an ADR for OpenAlex/pyalex integration.
  2. Implement new OpenAlex modules using the `pyalex` library:
     - Client wrapper
     - Publication retriever
     - Author retriever
     - Concept retriever
     - Utilities and optional bulk downloader
  3. Develop and run unit tests for these modules.
  4. Debug and iterate until robust.
  5. Document the integration process and results.
  6. Update main documentation to reflect new OpenAlex/pyalex capabilities.

## 4. Next Steps

- Draft ADR for OpenAlex/pyalex integration.
- Begin implementation of pyalex-based modules.
- Develop and run tests.
- Document progress and update main documentation.
