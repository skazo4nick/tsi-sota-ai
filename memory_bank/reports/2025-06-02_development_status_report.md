# Development Status Report

**Date:** 2025-06-02

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the current status and next steps for external publication API integrations in the repository, focusing on the recent CORE API module refactor and the planned OpenAlex/pyalex integration.

---

## 2. CORE API Module Update

- The `core_api_client.py` module was refactored for full endpoint coverage and robust search capabilities.
- Key improvements:
  - Added/updated search functions: `search_works_by_keyword`, `search_works_by_doi`, `search_works_by_title`, `search_works_by_author`, and `search_works_by_field`.
  - Updated entity retrieval functions to use correct endpoints and support all subresources.
  - Improved error handling and type checks throughout the module.
  - Validated that new search functions return correct results.
- All major CORE API endpoints are now supported, including `/works/{id}`, `/works/{id}/outputs`, `/works/{id}/stats`, `/works/tei/{id}`, and `/works/{id}/download`.
- B2 integration tests passed; CORE API tests now pass with the updated module.

## 3. OpenAlex/pyalex Integration Plan

- The current OpenAlex client is a basic, direct HTTP implementation with limited coverage (see `openaalex_customclass_report.md`).
- Plan:
  1. Draft and commit an ADR for OpenAlex/pyalex integration.
  2. Implement new OpenAlex modules using the `pyalex` library:
     - Client wrapper
     - Publication retriever
     - Author retriever
     - Concept retriever
     - Utilities and optional bulk downloader
  3. Develop and run unit tests for these modules.
  4. Debug and iterate until robust.
  5. Document the integration process and results.
  6. Update main documentation to reflect new OpenAlex/pyalex capabilities.

---

## 4. Next Steps

- Draft ADR for OpenAlex/pyalex integration.
- Begin implementation of pyalex-based modules.
- Develop and run tests.
- Document progress and update main documentation.

## 5. References
- See `memory_bank/development/openaalex_customclass_report.md` for a detailed comparison of the current OpenAlex client and the official API.
- See `core_api_client.py` for the updated CORE API integration.

## 2025-06-02: Springer Nature API Client Development Plan

Based on the analysis in `springernature_api_client_report.md` and the official documentation ([dev.springernature.com/docs/python-api-wrapper/](https://dev.springernature.com/docs/python-api-wrapper/)), the following plan is established to achieve full, robust integration with the Springer Nature API:

### 1. Replace Dummy Functions
- Implement real API calls in `openaccess.py` using the official `springernature-api-client` Python wrapper (available on PyPI) or `requests` as a fallback.

### 2. Full Integration with Official Wrapper
- Use the [`springernature-api-client`](https://pypi.org/project/springernature-api-client/) for all interactions.
- Leverage built-in pagination, retries, and advanced querying features provided by the wrapper.

### 3. Add Advanced Querying
- Support boolean logic, complex filters, and sorting in queries.
- Expose these as function parameters in the client and downloader modules.

### 4. Support All Endpoints
- Add support for `/metadata` and `/fulltext` endpoints, not just `/openaccess`.
- Ensure XML, JATS, and HTML formats are supported as needed.

### 5. Improve Pagination
- Implement full paging logic in bulk downloads and expose controls to the user.

### 6. Enhance Documentation
- Expand usage examples, especially for real API calls and error scenarios.
- Update README and in-code docstrings to reflect new capabilities.

### 7. Testing
- Add unit and integration tests with mock API responses for all major functions and error cases.

## Springer Nature API Client: Current Status (2025-06-02)
- The Springer Nature client is now fully integrated via the `sn_custom_client/` wrapper, which uses the official `springernature-api-client` PyPI package.
- All dummy logic has been replaced with real API calls, and the wrapper is robust to import conflicts and devcontainer issues.
- Rate limiting, error handling, and logging are robust and follow Springer Nature guidelines.
- All tests for `sn_xml_downloader.py` and the client pass in the devcontainer.
- Next steps: expand advanced querying, support all endpoints, and continue to improve documentation and tests as needed.
