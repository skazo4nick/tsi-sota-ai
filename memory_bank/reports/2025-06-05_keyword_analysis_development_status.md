## üìã Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Next 24-48 Hours)
1. **Focus exclusively on data acquisition debugging**
2. **Create minimal test scripts for API validation**
3. **Document exact API responses for analysis**
4. **Compare behavior with Semantic Scholar UI manually**

### Short-term Goals (Next Week)
1. **Resolve data acquisition issues**
2. **Deploy prepared analysis frameworks**
3. **Generate initial keyword analysis results**
4. **Validate full pipeline functionality**

### Success Criteria for Resolution
- **Duplication rate < 20%**
- **Minimum 50+ unique publications retrieved**
- **Consistent API response behavior across queries**
- **Reproducible results**

## üéØ Conclusion

The keyword analysis module represents a significant technical achievement with comprehensive, production-ready analysis capabilities. However, the project is currently **completely blocked** by a data acquisition issue that appears to be related to Semantic Scholar API configuration rather than fundamental implementation problems.

**Critical Decision Point**: The next 2-3 days are crucial for project success. If data acquisition issues cannot be resolved quickly, consideration should be given to:
1. Alternative data sources (OpenAlex, ArXiv)
2. Hybrid approaches combining multiple APIs
3. Manual data collection as fallback

**Confidence Assessment**: High confidence in rapid deployment once data issues are resolved, given the comprehensive infrastructure already in place.

**Next Update**: Upon resolution of data acquisition issues or within 48 hours  
**Distribution**: Project stakeholders, technical team  
**Priority Level**: CRITICAL - Immediate attention required
