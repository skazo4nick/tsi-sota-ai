### Design and Architecture

**System Overview:**  
The Research Assistant system is a multi-agent application built on LangGraph and CrewAI, designed to process and analyze scientific publications from various sources.

**Core Components:**

1. **Storage Layers:**  
   - **Modules:**  
     - *B2Storage:* Integration with Backblaze B2 for object storage.  
     - *QdrantStorage:* Integration with Qdrant for vector storage.  
     - *MeilisearchStorage:* Integration with Meilisearch for markdown content.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.  
     - Decoupling of storage logic for flexibility in handling diverse content types.

2. **Data Sources:**  
   - **Modules:**  
     - *ArxivAPIClient:* Implementation for Arxiv API.  
     - *SemanticScholarAPIClient:* Implementation for Semantic Scholar API.  
     - *CoreAPIClient:* Implementation for CORE API.  
     - *OpenAlexAPIClient:* Implementation for Open Alex API.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Standardized interface for content retrieval.  
     - Extensibility for future API integrations.

**Agent Architecture:**

1. **Research Agents:**  
   - **Publication Retrieval Agent:** Handles API interactions, manages rate limits, and normalizes data formats.  
   - **Content Analysis Agent:** Processes text content, extracts key information, and identifies relationships.  
   - **Image Analysis Agent:** Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for image recognition, processes scientific visualizations, extracts information from graphs and diagrams, and is implemented in [Image and Table Analysis ADR](2024_04_29_adr_image_table_analysis.md).  
   - **Table Analysis Agent:** Uses Mistral Structured OCR, processes tabular data, implements pandas for data analysis, and is implemented in [Image and Table Analysis ADR](2024_04_29_adr_image_table_analysis.md).

2. **Communication Layer:** Text-based communication between agents, shared memory implementation, and state management through LangGraph.

**Processing Pipeline:**

1. **Initial Processing:** PDF extraction, content classification, metadata extraction.
2. **Content Analysis:** Text processing, image analysis (via Image Analysis Agent), table processing (via Table Analysis Agent).
3. **Information Integration:** Data normalization, relationship mapping, knowledge graph updates.

**Integration Points:**

1. **External Services:**  
   - **Cloud Services:** Qdrant Cloud for vector storage, Meilisearch for full-text search, object storage for documents.  
   - **AI Services:** Multiple LLM providers, Gemini 2.5 Flash for image analysis, Mistral OCR for table extraction.

**Monitoring and Maintenance:**

1. **Performance Metrics:** Processing times, API usage, storage efficiency, agent performance.
2. **Quality Metrics:** Content extraction accuracy, relationship identification, data consistency, processing completeness.
