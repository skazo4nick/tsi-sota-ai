### Design and Architecture

**System Overview:**  
The Knowledge Retrieval Agentic System is built on a modular design with clearly defined boundaries between API integration, storage, knowledge representation, context management, and workflow orchestration. The architecture facilitates scalability, maintainability, and extensibility across all stages of development.

**Architecture Components:**

1. **API Integration Layer:**  
   - **Modules:**  
     - *BaseAPIClient:* Abstract base class for API clients.  
     - *SpringerAPIClient:* Implementation for SpringerNature API.  
     - *CoreAPIClient:* Implementation for CORE API.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Standardized interface for content retrieval.  
     - Extensibility for future API integrations.

2. **Storage Layer:**  
   - **Modules:**  
     - *B2Storage:* Integration with Backblaze B2 for object storage.  
     - *QdrantStorage:* Integration with Qdrant for vector storage.  
     - *MeilisearchStorage:* Integration with Meilisearch for markdown content.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.  
     - Decoupling of storage logic for flexibility in handling diverse content types.

3. **Knowledge Graph (Neo4j):**  
   - **Components:**  
     - *Entity Management:* Creation and management of entities.  
     - *Relationship Management:* Creation and management of relationships.  
     - *Query Interface:* Interface for complex graph queries.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Efficient graph traversal for complex queries.  
     - Scalability for large knowledge graphs.

4. **Context Management:**  
   - **Components:**  
     - *Context Hierarchy:* Hierarchical structure for contexts.  
     - *Context Merging:* Capability to merge contexts.  
     - *Context Chain Tracking:* Tracking of context chains.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Efficient context retrieval and management.  
     - Flexibility in context representation.

5. **Workflow Orchestration:**  
   - **Components:**  
     - *Agent Framework:* Based on smolagents.  
     - *Workflow Definitions:* Definitions of workflows.  
     - *Agent Communication:* Communication between agents.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Modular agent design.  
     - Flexible workflow definitions.

6. **Retrieval Interface:**  
   - **Components:**  
     - *Semantic Search:* Vector-based retrieval using Qdrant.  
     - *Context-Aware Retrieval:* Retrieval with context consideration.  
     - *Knowledge Graph Navigation:* Navigation through the knowledge graph.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Efficient retrieval mechanisms.  
     - User-friendly interface.

**Design Artifacts:**  
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Visual representations detailing system components and interactions.  
- **Module Specifications:** Documentation outlining individual module responsibilities, data inputs/outputs, and API contracts.  
- **Data Schemas:** Definitions for the structure of data used at various stages, including inputs, intermediate formats, and final outputs.

**Rationale for the Design:**  
- **Modularity:** Allows easier maintenance, testing, and scalability.  
- **Clarity in Data Flow:** Supports reproducible analysis and smooth transitions between project phases.  
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Enables integration of new data sources and analytic techniques without major overhauls.
