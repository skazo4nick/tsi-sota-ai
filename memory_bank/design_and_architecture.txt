### Design and Architecture

**System Overview:**  
The project is built on a modular design with clearly defined boundaries between data ingestion, processing, analysis, and deployment. The architecture facilitates scalability, maintainability, and reproducibility across all stages of development.

**Architecture Components:**

1. **Data Acquisition & Ingestion:**  
   - **Modules:**  
     - *Article Downloader:* Retrieves article content from various sources.  
     - *PDF Downloader:* Handles downloading and basic processing of PDF files.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Robust error handling for varying data formats.  
     - Logging and validation of downloaded content.

2. **Data Parsing & Processing:**  
   - **Modules:**  
     - *HTML Parser:* Extracts structured data from HTML content.  
     - *Utility Functions:* Shared routines for data cleaning and transformation.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Consistent data formatting to enable downstream processing.  
     - Decoupling of parsing logic for flexibility in handling diverse sources.

3. **Data Analysis & Clustering:**  
   - **Components:**  
     - *Interactive Notebooks:* Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks/ directory facilitate exploratory analysis.  
     - *Clustering & Embedding Generation:* Tools and scripts to analyze relationships and generate clusters from processed data.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Clear separation between raw data and processed outputs.  
     - Ability to reproduce analysis through versioned notebooks.

4. **Inter-module Communication:**  
   - **APIs & Interfaces:**  
     - Defined contracts between modules to ensure smooth data flow.  
     - Use of shared data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) to encapsulate intermediate results.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Modular design enables individual components to be tested and updated independently.  
     - Clear interface definitions reduce coupling between modules.

5. **Support for Deployment and Operation:**  
   - **Components:**  
     - Environment configuration files (`requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`) to manage dependencies.  
     - Scripts and documentation to guide deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.
   - **Key Considerations:**  
     - Ensuring that the runtime environment remains consistent across development, testing, and production.  
     - Automating repetitive tasks such as environment setup with CI/CD pipelines.

**Design Artifacts:**  
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Visual representations (such as flowcharts or UML diagrams) detailing system components and interactions.  
- **Module Specifications:** Documentation outlining individual module responsibilities, data inputs/outputs, and API contracts.  
- **Data Schemas:** Definitions for the structure of data used at various stages, including inputs, intermediate formats, and final outputs.

**Rationale for the Design:**  
- **Modularity:** Allows easier maintenance, testing, and scalability.  
- **Clarity in Data Flow:** Supports reproducible analysis and smooth transitions between project phases.  
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Enables integration of new data sources and analytic techniques without major overhauls.
